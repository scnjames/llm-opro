She sent me a text message claiming to have finalized documents with TB ; I did not respond. \n\nI had spoken with one of my real estate friends concerning this debacle with XXXX staff and this vehicle and she gave me the name of another XXXX representative that she knew. On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to the lady and explained the situation to her concerning this vehicle and how XXXX was conducting business. Her recommendation to me was as soon as you can, return that vehicle to their lot, give the keys back and let them know that you dont want to do business with them. She stated that it was messy and it should not have taken all of that. I got into the vehicle and drove to XXXX XXXX right after I finished speaking with her. I was accompanied by someone to the dealership. \n\nOn XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I walked into XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX and told the manager and the young lady at the front desk that I was returning a vehicle. They asked me was it for service? I responded in the negative and told them that I was returning it for them to keep. He asked if it had a lien on it? I told him that nothing was on it and that it had never been financed. I also expressed my disgust with how his staff member pulled my credit a number of times and I told him that this is not how you do business and I would not be doing business with them. I also stated that if there was nothing else for me to do then I was leaving. He and the lady asked me who had worked with me and I provided the names. He said that the female was there and he left my presence. While I was inquiring again as to whether I needed to do anything else, the female staff member came out. She spoke and I spoke to her and she began to say something to the effect of we have been in touch, I sent you a message. I said NO, I dont want the vehicle and this is not how you do business. I also addressed the fact that she pulled my credit numerous times. She began to say that I gave her permission and I said to her again, NO, you had my permission to pull my credit for XXXX XXXX and anything beyond that, you shouldve been contacting me!! She said okay and then walked away from me. I prepared to depart from the dealership when she eventually walked back over to me and stated the bank is still going to hold you responsible. I said what bank is holding me responsible? She responded Town Bank. I responded I havent signed any documents with town bank and I didnt do any business with Town Bank . She responded okay and walked away from me. I then told the person who accompanied me that I was ready to leave and we departed. \n\nOn XXXX XX/XX/XXXX someone from a mortgage company did a soft pull on my credit report and told me that the female at XXXX had pulled my credit a total of 15 times. I was livid when I learned of this because I had only seen it 4 times AND I had a pre-approval when I arrived at the dealer so there was no sensible reason to pull my credit beyond the one time that I gave permission for. At this time, there was nothing on my credit report regarding the vehicle in question or TowneBank. \n\nOn XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to my credit union to obtain another pre-approval for a vehicle. Naturally the rate provided was higher than the previous one due to the many inquiries on my report. \n\nOn XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I received a text from the female member being sarcastic concerning the vehicle and telling me that I needed to pick up my XXXX or her manager will have it removed from their lot. She also left a message on my phone asking that I return her call to discuss the vehicle. I ignored both, the message and the voicemail. I did not make contact with her at all. I was determined NOT to do any business with that establishment. The vehicle had been returned with no financing, therefore it was never my vehicle. I had also decided that I would seek legal guidance, so I began to go online researching consumer attorneys. \n\nOn XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I texted my brother and asked if he would go with me to purchase a vehicle. I spoke with him again on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and we agreed to go on the next day ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I received notification that an envelope had arrived for me from TowneBank. I received an email notification regarding my credit report on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX early, so I checked it as the message suggested. I looked on my credit report ( XXXX ) to find that Town Bank had loaded a bill for {$35000.00} for a vehicle that ( 1 ) was not in my possession and ( 2 ) that I NEVER purchased from them or anyone else. I immediately checked my XXXX and XXXX reports. It was listed on my XXXX but not the XXXX. I called my brother and told him about it and he postponed the vehicle shopping and told me to take care of this matter first. I reached out to all three and placed freezes on my reports until further notice. I went online and submitted a dispute for those that showed up on my reports. I also contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) concerning the matter. \n\nOn XXXX XX/XX/XXXX a lady called my phone from Town Bank ( XXXX ) leaving a voice message, stating that she wanted to verify some information with me regarding the purchase of a XXXX XXXX XXXX.

She called my phone again on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and left a message. \n\nOn XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I reached out to the XXXX XXXX XXXX and was instructed to send documentation to their establishment for review, so I forwarded the documents that I have regarding this matter. \n\nOn XXXX XXXX another lady from Town Bank called my phone requesting that I return her call to ( XXXX ) XXXX. I did not return the call. After various conversations with XXXX staff, one of the attorneys instructed me to reach out to TowneBank to obtain a copy of the contract that they are attempting to enforce against me. \n\nOn XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I called one of the ladies who had reached out to me from XXXX to request a copy of the contract. I explained that I had never submitted an application to or signed documents requesting a loan from them and that I wanted to have a copy of the contract. I also mentioned that I was seeking legal guidance. The representative responded that I would need to have the attorney contact them to obtain this. I stated that as a consumer, I was entitled to a copy since they were claiming that I had submitted it. She eventually provided the address to me. I typed an email request for a copy of the documents soon after and submitted it. \n\nOn XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I received a copy via email of the XXXX XXXX XXXX from the bank.

Customer requested transaction detail ( bank drawn on/bank money returned to including last digits of account number ). My intent was to see if one of MY banks had declined the transactions. The bank officer said that information was unavailable. Customer tried looking up information on all possible payment methods ( my checking, CCs, debit, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc.-ever way it was possible that I originally paid ). Transaction detail information was finally found on the Wells Fargo website nested several layers down. There was still no explanation for WHY the original charges were reversed ( there was plenty of money in both accounts ). I called the XXXX number again after making a third payment attempt. This time the associate said that whenever a new payment type is set up, a customer must call the XXXX number and verify OR THE PAYMENT WILL BE REVERSED. \n\nThis information was not disclosed by the Nursery associate who filled out the credit application with me. This information was not disclosed by email at the time that my acceptance email was sent nor when the CC itself was sent. It was not disclosed when I set up my online account and made the first payment. If it was included in the wording of any literature attached, it was buried or worded in such a way as to seem trivial. Additionally, this is not a customary procedure for making online payments ; therefore, it was not anticipated as a part of a procedure. \n\nI believe that this is a fraud to get at least one late payment fee from new CC customers. \n\nOn a personal level, I am angry about a late payment fee when I paid ( twice ) on time.

XXXX MI, XXXX. We were told to write this letter to you by one of your Loss Mitigation Managers, XXXX, ID number XXXX. I would first and foremost like to start off by saying that we are very proud of being first time homeowners, and indeed want to keep the home that we have worked very hard to attain. Unfortunately, Flagstar is trying to make that virtually impossible. This all started during the COVID-19 Pandemic. We, like most homeowners, were affected by this pandemic. We lost an income due to the world and state orders of being on lock down. So, while one of us were able to work from home, one of us were not able to work during this time. At this time Flagstar Bank offered a COVID- 19 Pandemic hardship program option where we were told that we could not make payments on our mortgage and that when we were ready to get back on track to simply give them a call and we would be able to get right back on track. Well, unfortunately that is not what happened. What happened instead was that in XXXX of XXXX I, XXXX XXXX, reached out to Flagstar and stated that our hardship had been resolved and that both individuals at the home were both back to work and ready to make payments. From that time to the current time, we have submitted over 10 lost mitigation applications all accompanied with every document requested. However, with every application submitted and all the documents submitted there was and is always another caveat that was thrown in and when we call its always Yes, we got all the documents, but the underwriters stated that this is needed and this has been going on since XX/XX/XXXX with every application submitted. We submit what the underwrites wants and are told time and time again that all documents were not submitted. As of recently my husband, XXXX XXXX, taxes forms, bank statements and profit and loss statements from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX has been requested and supplied, they then came back and stated that we had to circle all the deposits on the bank statement, we did that and now we are being told that the deposits and the expenses has to not only be circled but labeled and that the profit and loss statement has to be detailed right down to every transaction that has occurred. What I do know is that as long as the profit and loss statement is within 18 % of matching what is on the bank statement it is acceptable. Our bank statements and profit and loss statements for XXXX XXXX match 100 %. At this point it feels as if Flagstar Bank is not in the business of helping us get back on track but instead is more interested in taking our home from us. We have been assigned multiple single points of contacts and, each and, every time I call, they are never available. A human being from Flagstar has NEVER called me, its always the automated system telling me to call back for a very important message. We have also taken advantage of the only assistance that is offered in Michigan for homeowners which gave us {$25000.00} to go towards our balance and even then, Flagstar was not able to get out mortgage back on track. We had people come to our home and tape notices to our door as well as even taken pictures of our house. Now this is getting out of hand. We are only trying to get our mortgage back on track and keep our home, and we feel as if this is some form of harassment. Everyone is stating that its simple fix, but we have not found the simple fix of any of this. We are requesting that this situation gets rectified sooner than later so that we can avoid the mental, health, and stress related issues that this has caused as well as keep our home. This should be rectified without any further documents being requested, as all the documents has been submitted. This letter is also being sent certified mail to the Attorney General and the Department of Regulatory Affairs. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, XXXX & XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CFPB Closef the initial complaint from the mortgage company based on their reply of a denial but all income information submitted has not been reviewed as of XX/XX/XXXX.

Upon meticulous review of my credit report, I have identified numerous discrepancies that demand your immediate attention and correction, as they are in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). \n\nInaccuracies and Violations : Repossession Status : The account status is erroneously reported as \" Repossession '' with a balance of {$16000.00}. However, I must emphasize that this information is patently incorrect. To clarify, there has been no repossession of the vehicle in question. This misreporting violates the FCRA 's mandate for accurate and fair credit reporting. \n\nUnsubstantiated Past Due Amount : The reported past due amount of {$16000.00} as of XX/XX/2023 is not only inaccurately inflated but also unsupported by any evidence. This substantial discrepancy does not align with the terms of my loan agreement, nor does it reflect the payments I have diligently made.

The account should not be reported as \" Repossession '' when it has not been repossessed.\n\nAccurate Past Due Amount : Ensure that the past due amount is reported in compliance with the terms of my loan agreement and my actual payment history. \n\nVerification and Documentation : Conduct a comprehensive verification process with DriveTime/XXXX to substantiate the accuracy of the reported details, and provide documented evidence of this verification process. \n\nTimely Resolution : I am fully aware that the FCRA mandates a prompt resolution to credit report disputes, typically within 30 days. I implore XXXX to adhere to this legal timeframe diligently. \n\nCommunication and Confirmation : Please furnish me with clear, detailed, and written confirmation of the actions taken to rectify these inaccuracies on my XXXX credit report. \n\nI want to stress the critical importance of accurate credit reporting, not only for my personal financial well-being but also for the overall integrity of the credit reporting system. I hold XXXX accountable for upholding the principles and laws governing credit reporting. \n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

When making payments the next day I found that my total balance of all accounts with the company had dropped from approximately {$2300.00} to {$0.00} ( see attached screenshots ) after paying them {$310.00} ; this final balance was so small their system refused to allow me to pay. Based on this notice provided by the company 's own billing system, I believed my balance had been adjusted based on their review of the evidence I had provided and that my obligations were thereby effectively settled as a result of their recognition of the debt being invalid, and I had no further communication with \" Elite Collection Services '' after that time. However, Elite Recovery Group, LLC/ '' Elite Collection Services '' appears to have either erred in failing to report the ( still invalid ) debt as paid or ignored their duty to reinvestigate a disputed debt under the FDCPA and simply reported the invalid debt as in collections. \nMisrepresenting the amount of a debt : When asked for documentation of the invalid debt, the invoice document provided by \" Elite Collection Services '' indicated an initial total charge of approximately {$1700.00} ( see attached statement ), most or all of which charges I had evidence to refute in the aforementioned video. However, upon examination of my credit reports, I noticed the initial balance of the account was actually reported as {$1600.00} ; in addition, when the invalid debt was reported as in collections to XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX ( under the \" Elite Collection Service '' name ) the amount reported of {$1900.00} reflected neither the unadjusted original balance from XX/XX/XXXX minus the {$310.00} I had paid, nor the {$0.00} their own billing system had shown as the total balance of all my accounts with the company as of XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nFailure to provide an itemized accounting : Though \" Elite Collection Services '' provided the aforementioned invoice upon request, at no point did I receive any documentation itemizing interest, fees or other additional charges added to the invalid debt despite verbally making that request.\n\nPursuing a debt they have no legal right to pursue : As this invalid debt was originally reported to credit bureaus in XXXX XXXX  XXXX and Elite Collection Services , LLC was not incorporated as an LLC until XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  XXXX in the State of Washington ( see attached documentation ), they can not be the first collection agency to have reported the invalid debt, Curiously, the website for Elite Recovery Group, LLC claims they were \" converted '' from \" Elite Collection Services '' in XXXX, but this is a factually untrue statement ; no state records indicate that Elite Recovery Group was \" converted '' or legally connected to any previous entity in any way. However, the entity which presumably did first report the debt, Elite Collection Services , LLC, was not a valid business entity in its purported home state of Washington as of XXXX XXXX  XXXX due to voluntary dissolution by the owner, after which the company was never reinstated ( see attached documentation ). Instead, the sole member of the now-dissolved Elite Collection Services , LLC appears to have intentionally failed to inform the State of Oregon that their Washington LLC was dissolved and then used the said dissolved LLC 's now-invalid but still-extant foreign LLC registration in Oregon to fradulently establish purportedly Oregon-based foreign LLC authorities in Washington and Nevada, and to falsely claim to be Oregon-based in the National Multistate Licensing System ( see documentation ; note in particular that the claimed formation date for the alleged Oregon-based version of Elite Collection Services , LLC in XXXX is XX/XX/XXXX XXXX which is in fact the date that the original Washington-based Elite Collection Services , LLC was granted authorization as a foreign LLC in Oregon ) . All the while, the owner continued to claim the now-dissolved Washington-based LLC was still valid to the State of Oregon, rather than incorporating as a domestic LLC in Oregon at any point ; indeed, no Oregon-domestic corporation by the name of Elite Collection Services , LLC appears to have ever existed . Thus, it would not have been possible for Elite Collection Services , LLC to legally or rightfully obtain rights to pursue the invalid debt in XXXX or to transfer said rights to a third party such as Elite Recovery Group, LLC, at any point thereafter, as no such company as Elite Collection Services , LLC had a valid legal existence as an operational corporation in any state after XXXX XXXX  XXXX. Therefore, all attempts to collect upon said invalid debt or transfer that debt to a third party by \" Elite Collection Services, '' Elite Collection Services , LLC, Elite Recovery Group, LLC and any of their employees or officers have been, are and will continue to be invalid and illegal.", "answer": "#### Debt collection"}, {"question": "I paid my entire Citi Bank credit card balance of {$7000.00} via XXXX XXXX ACH transfer on XX/XX/23 to Citi Bank.

My son and I applied for a loan together so we could purchase a home and never be thrown out on the street again. It took us several months, but we found a home and secured a loan. The mortgage has been with Wells Fargo Bank for the last ten or so years. The reason my son co-signed was to help me secure a loan due to my low credit score and income. In XXXX of XXXX my son bought a home, got married. Its long overdue and time to remove my son from this loan and take him off the deed.

The debt collector told me I had to write the dispute in hand and send it to their address. I did exactly like and did not receive a response. I also stapled the receipt I got from XXXX for returning their router and terminating services. Here is the shipping tracking number via XXXX and it also has signature required meaning the lawyer received the letter and did not even try to communicate with my back. To this day I am waiting for them to write back. It read : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Attention : XXXX XXXX, XXXX. \nSubject : Dispute regarding incorrect collection account for XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear XXXX XXXX, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to address a concerning matter related to a collection account associated with XXXX XXXX internet service, which your firm is handling on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX. I recently became aware of a balance amounting to {$150.00} that is allegedly owed to XXXX, consisting of an outstanding balance of approximately {$98.00} and accumulated late fees. \n\nAllow me to provide you with a detailed account of the events in question. On XX/XX/XXXX, I subscribed to XXXX XXXX internet service, taking advantage of their advertised XXXX trial period. After a brief trial period, I determined that the service did not meet my expectations, as it performed poorly overall. Consequently, I made the decision to return the product on XX/XX/XXXX, which regrettably exceeded the specified XXXX trial period. \n\nDuring the return process, I obtained XXXX receipts, which I have retained for your reference. XXXX receipt pertains to the return of the router, and the other acknowledges my payment of {$55.00} for the utilized service. However, according to the XXXX representative who assisted me, my account was in good standing, and I did not owe any outstanding balance and led to my cancellation of the services. Therefore, I believed that I had fulfilled my obligations and settled any financial matters related to the service. \n\nSubsequently, in an attempt to verify the status of my account, I tried accessing my XXXX  online account using my provided username and password. To my surprise, I encountered an unexpected hurdle when prompted to enter a phone number associated with the router. The phone number listed on the receipt was invalid, rendering me unable to proceed. Based on this information, I naturally assumed that my account had been entirely closed due to the return and cancellation of the service. \n\nMonths later, to my dismay, I discovered a negative inquiry on my credit report indicating the existence of a collection account attributed to XXXX. This discovery prompted me to initiate a dispute with the credit bureau in an effort to rectify this erroneous entry. Unfortunately, my dispute was unsuccessful, necessitating my direct correspondence with your esteemed firm. \nIt is important to note that the {$55.00} payment made at the time of returning the router and any fees was intended to settle any outstanding charges for the utilized service. Therefore, I am deeply concerned by the inclusion of this amount in the alleged outstanding balance. I request your thorough investigation into this matter to ensure the accuracy and fairness of the collection account. \n\nXXXX XXXX, I firmly believe that this collection account is unwarranted and should never have been initiated in the first place. As a result, I kindly request your assistance in resolving this matter expeditiously. I expect both XXXX and Amsher Collection SE to take immediate action to rectify the situation by clearing the erroneous collection account from my credit history.\n\nI trust that you will thoroughly investigate this issue, including the improper inclusion of the {$55.00} payment in the outstanding balance, and reach a fair resolution. In doing so, I request that you provide me with a written response confirming the resolution of this matter and ensuring the removal of any negative entries related to this collection account from my credit report. I also expect my XXXX receipts to the return address of this letter for record purposes. \n\nI appreciate your attention to this pressing matter and anticipate a prompt resolution. Should you require any further information or documentation, please do not hesitate to contact me at the provided contact details. I am a busy man and will most likely miss your call- you can email me. Thank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to a satisfactory resolution. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, I decided to call XXXX  because XXXX was not responding to me.

But soon afterwards I realized this was not the correct- a payment should not be going to Citibank XXXX but a payment should have been coming from Citibank XXXX So I called my credit Union back to stop/cancel the balance transfer to Citibank, but credit Union said I had to call the member services department on Monday to cancel or reverse the balance transfer. And she assured me that the balance transfer would not be sent right away since it was the weekend. So I called Citibank back and asked again about the balance transfer and Citibank told me i couldn't make the transfer over the phone and had to make the transfer online thru their website. So I made the balance transfer online- {$5000.00} balance transfer to my Credit Union.. So I called my credit Union on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, to cancel/stop or reverse the balance transfer to Citibank I requested in error. The manager at the credit union said ok, she would have the balance transfer stopped. But about three days later, I saw the balance transfer from the Credit Union posted to my Citibank account. My Credit Union did not stop the balance transfer transaction and did not notify me about my transfer. So I called the manager at Credit Union on Wednesday, XXXX XXXX, and asked her why she didn't cancel my balance transfer. The manager said she couldn't stop an electronic payment. So I said that she should have told me that from the beginning instead of having me believe she could stop it. The manager just apologized and said she didn't know she couldn't stop an electronic payment already in route. So I called Citibank and explained situation and requested they send back the {$5000.00} payment from Credit Union or send me a refund check for {$5000.00}.

It put me out of work for 6 months. I had no choice. I had to file bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is another story. For Freedom Mortgage, after bankruptcy this is where the nightmare began. While I was in Bankruptcy I was making my payments as well as Bankruptcy and I was making full payments. Most months I paid more than my payment. My time frame may be a little off, but 1 year after bankruptcy Freedom Mortgage said I was behind in payments, but when they look at their system they're saying that they see I have been making my payments. For over a year every time I called talking to a different person every time, I was told I was behind in my payments, but when they look in their system they see I was making my payments. I would always ask how I was behind when you see I'm making my payments every month and as always they would put in for a review. So I started sending my payments certified with a mail back receipt that they sign. I have been doing that for almost 4 years now. I even started recording some of the phone calls of Freedom Mortgage. On 2 occasion I have their supervisors on recording stating I was not behind and that they see where I was making my payments and not missing XXXX payment and to keep doing what I'm doing. So they decided to put me on a forbearance plan until they get the issue straight. Not knowing that was bad for me and my credit. So I was on that plan for 3 - 6 months. I call back after that time ended and I was told again from another person I was missing payments and I tried to talk to the same supervisor. All I got was a voice recording. Never did talk to that person again. Again I was put on another forbearance plan for 3 - 6 months. So I decided to seek help, because now they are trying to take my home. I called over 100 lawyers and all I heard was I don't handle that type of case. Here is the bad thing. MORTGAGE companies like FREEDOM MORTGAGE know this. They know how hard you will find help and that's why they do what they do. I did find a lawyer that did look at everything I had and what Freedom Mortgage sent me for over 4 years. After looking at a few pages, he found the problem. Freedom Mortgage is saying they never got any payments from bankruptcy. Everyone know bankruptcy paid Freedom Mortgage. That lawyer never did finished the job I paid for. That is also another story. By this time Freedom Mortgage has started foreclosure. So now it time to find help again. It took days calling lawyers again. I found 2 lawyers that are willing to take the case and both lawyers said I have a case. BUT. It's going to take a large amount of money. Lets say {$350.00} - {$500.00} a hour. So I called Freedom Mortgage asking to talk but this time talking to a man that says he was over everyone. Not going to say his name. Ok I told him everything that was found and he told me to get proof that bankruptcy did send payments and that would fix the problems and he gave me his email to send it to. He as well as I did not think I was going to get that info. I did not even know where to start. I'm no lawyer. So I called bankruptcy court and told them what was going on. I have to say they got mad because Freedom Mortgage said they did not get any payment from them. While I was on the phone with the court, she sent everything to my email and had me to open it and walked me through it showing that Freedom Mortgage was paid through a XXXX party company and from there it was sent to Freedom Mortgage and they cashed the check at their bank and the date they cashed all checks. So I emailed everything to this person at Freedom Mortgage. Remember at the beginning I said buckle up. Now this ride is going to go fast. I Called Freedom Mortgage 2 days after I sent everything to this person to speak to this person and as usual this person would not talk to me PERIOD and everyone I'm now talking to is RUDE and SHORT. They are now saying I'm missing payments from XXXX to now. The date is XXXX and this was last week. Over {$13000.00} I'm now behind. This is what they are now saying. Now I'm back to square XXXX. I told them what I've been saying all along. I'm not behind and I send My payments certified with a mail back receipt. I was trying to tell the Lady I was talking to at the time the payments I have made ever month up to XXXX I was cut off rudely. You have to send us proof. I was giving and emailing to send proof of payment. What Freedom Mortgage didn't know was I already had that in hand. Since all of this has started I made copies of everything I do with Freedom Mortgage. Bank statements, bank drifts, and images of the checks I send every month and the dates they cashed my payments. I sent all of that to their lost mitigation department last week. Today when I got home Freedom Mortgage sent a package by XXXX about some type of agreement saying if I don't pay the {$13000.00} of what i supposedly owe that they would take my house. The question I have is where is all my payments going? They want me to pay for something that has already been paid for. If I don't pay, they want to take my home one way or another. This is my home. I worked hard for it like so many others. This is my dream home. I'm living where I always wanted to. I didn't even apply for a loan through Freedom Mortgage. I went through a bank for my Mortgage not knowing that a bank would just up and sale out like that hurts. That's fine that they did, but let the customers find choose who they want as a mortgage lender. Someone like me is going to do their homework before going with anyone like Freedom Mortgage. Freedom Mortgage is out here destroying families. Putting people through so much hardship. I have been fighting with Freedom Mortgage for 4 years and I can't do it alone.

They said they were calling because they recived an alert about fraud on my account. They mentioned to be on a recorded line, and wanted to verify some transactions with me. However before proceeding they said they had to make sure it was me. I did not verify any personal information with them. The person sent me text messages and ask that I verify the one time code, which I did. Unfortunately I do not have those text messages as my phone deletes messages after so many days. He proceeded to ask me about transactions from somewhere in Texas which I declined that I did not do. I do have my call log still which I will be sending.

Then he mention that he will be shutting down my debit card and sending a new one. Next he tells me about another transaction for a wire transfer and I'm like wait a minute hold up that's not me. I try logging into my account but couldn't get in. He said he was going to escalate and put in a ticket to stop the transfer. I was on the phone for over an hour with this person thinking they were helping me to protect my account. He gave me a temporary password to get back into my account because I was unable to log in while on the phone with them. Then when I logged in that's went I saw the {$3900.00} wire transfer to some company I dont know. I asked if I can go ahead and change the password the person told me no and to wait 24 hrs. That's when I got to thinking why would a banker tell me that I can't update the temporary password.

I have also disputed this charge, and am hoping for a better result. However, if I do not receive one, I will reach out to you folks regarding that charge as well. For now, I am just trying to seek compensation for these XXXX charges that are illegitimate/made under false pretenses/could have been avoided had either Wells Fargo OR XXXX provided any customer support.\n\nI am sure there is more that I am not thinking of at this moment, but please feel free to reach out to me directly.

Again, I was unable to receive clarification that the charges were denied since the fraud department was closed, but given that the provisional credits were reversed, I am assuming this to be the case.

All this time I was denied access to my funds. I have been provided no explanation for this action.

I firmly believe that their actions represent a flagrant violation of numerous provisions within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's ( CFPB ) codes and federal laws. Specifically, I wish to highlight the following sections that apply to my dispute:1. Failure to Notify Customers and Employees ( CFPB Regulation X ) : ** American Car Center 's sudden closure on XXXX XXXX, without notifying its customers or employees is a clear violation of CFPB Regulation X, which mandates proper notification of such actions to mitigate potential harm to consumers. This lack of notification left me and other customers unaware of vital information concerning our lease/loan agreements. \n2. Failure to Provide Required Disclosures ( CFPB Regulation Z ) : Both American Car Center and Westlake Portfolio Management neglected to provide the essential disclosures required when a lease/loan is transferred, in direct violation of CFPB Regulation Z. These disclosures are critical to empowering consumers to make informed financial decisions.3. Deceptive Acts ( CFPB Regulation V ) : Westlake Portfolio Management 's deceptive email practices, wherein they impersonated American Car Center in their correspondence XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX followed by admissions of their true identity, constitute a series of deceptive acts, explicitly prohibited under CFPB Regulation V.4. Cancellation of Warranty Coverage without Remediation ( CFPB Regulation M ) : Westlake Portfolio Management 's unilateral cancellation of my limited warranty coverage, without offering an alternative or refund, directly contravenes CFPB Regulation M, which mandates transparency and fairness in consumer credit contracts. The original agreement with American Car Center included a commitment to address vehicle issues, which they upheld in the past.5. Failure to Provide Loan Documents ( CFPB Regulation B ) : American Car Center and Westlake Portfolio Management 's refusal to provide requested loan documents, offering only a payment history instead, is a blatant violation of CFPB Regulation B, which obligates creditors to provide requested credit information promptly.6. Failure to Provide Notice of Credit Reporting ( 15 USC 603 ) : Westlake Portfolio Management failed to provide me with proper notice regarding their intention to report my credit information, as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 USC 603 ). Their sudden reporting in XX/XX/2023 resulted in a significant and unwarranted XXXX drop in my credit score, causing severe financial hardship. .Thank you for your prompt attention to this grave matter.

I did some research on my own only to find very disturbing facts. Although not necessarily the fault of the servicing company ( ZuntaFi ) I found the reason for the increase was due to the FED RATE INCREASES. Two {$25000.00} balance loans now will cost an additional {$10000.00} EACH thanks to the FED Interest rate increases. Disgusting, but a complaint for another time and entity. It does relate to suggested resolution. \n\nThe complaint here is about THE CALCULATION OF PAYMENTS AND TOTAL AMOUNT TO BE COLLECTED. \n\nWhen I did the calculations across multiple student loan calculators I found there to be either too many payments, or too much collected per payment. This depends on how one looks at the loan. When I contacted ZuntaFi and brought this to attention I was given reasons relating to total collection and the sudden ( and significant ) monthly payment increase. The terms of the length of the loan was one reason. The terms of how payment increases may be made if the interest rate increases in order to keep the length of loan term within the contracted time was another reason. \n\nWhether I agree or disagree with those reasons has no room for debate. HOWEVER, under those conditions the way they calculate remaining payments results in my having to pay almost {$1500.00} OVER ... IN ADDITION TO... THE ACTUAL AMOUNT TOTAL AMOUNT DUE FOR EACH LOAN. \n\nEssentially 4 additional months of payments after the loan is paid in full. Once again multiple loan calculators confirm this when plugging in THE EXACT numbers provided by ZuntaFi INCLUDING the loan term as their excuse for how payment amounts are calculated. \n\nIt is my belief this would have been completely ignored and I would have paid more than {$3000.00} too much ( two loans of near equal value ) IN ADDITION TO the {$20000.00} total increase as a direct result of FED interest rate increases. \n\nWhen I made it aware to my contact at ZuntaFi she told me everything is governed by the contract and the amounts are correct. She sent me information that included payment history and some contracted information and basically closed the conversation ( there were several emails back and forth ). NONE OF THE INFORMATION SENT TO ME ADDRESSED THE CONFLICTING CALCULATIONS though I was told it would answer all of my questions. \n\nI have not contacted ZuntaFi since receiving and studying the information sent to me.

Importantly, this CD account was separate from my personal checking and savings accounts. However, due to a serious oversight on Citibank 's part, my personal checking and savings accounts were mistakenly closed instead of the intended CD account. \n\nUpon discovering the erroneous closure of their accounts, I promptly contacted Citibank 's customer service, only to be told that the closure had been executed at my own request.

The branch confirmed that this was, in fact, an internal error and not initiated by me. They assured me that checks to reimburse for the affected accounts would be issued within 7 to 10 days. \n\nHowever, the promised timeframe has extended to a month, and when I finally received a check from Citibank, it was incorrectly made out to another individual. To resolve this issue, I worked with branch personnel to initiate a stop-check request for the incorrect checks. I was informed that new checks would be reissued which I have yet to receive. \n\nFurthermore, Citibank conveyed that they were unable to reinstate my accounts due to the internal error, leaving me in a precarious financial situation. The delay in resolving this matter has had severe repercussions, including late payments and penalties on other accounts connected to these funds. \n\nMy long-standing and previously positive relationship with Citibank has been marred by an internal error that resulted in the incorrect closure of my personal checking and savings accounts.

I have been a loyal and responsible customer with Wells Fargo for nearly ten years, consistently meeting my mortgage obligations without any defaults or missed payments. However, I have recently encountered a troubling and unexplained change in the management of my escrow account, which has raised serious concerns about Wells Fargo 's motives and practices. \nThe issue at hand pertains to the sudden addition of a two-month reserve to my escrow account. What perplexes me is that this change has occurred after nearly a decade of maintaining my mortgage with Wells Fargo, and it was not an element discussed or included in the terms when I initially secured the loan. When I was shopping for mortgages a decade ago, no mention or indication was made regarding such a provision, nor was it ever part of our agreement. \nIn my particular case, I have been a loyal customer of Wells Fargo for the past ten years, diligently fulfilling my mortgage obligations without a single missed payment. However, recently, Wells Fargo added a two-month reserve, equivalent to {$3200.00}, to my escrow account. This addition was made without any explanation, and it stands in stark contrast to Wells Fargo 's Truth-in-Lending Disclosure from 2013, which influenced my decision to choose Wells Fargo as my mortgage provider a decade ago. At that time, I selected Wells Fargo as my lender, in part, because there was no provision for such an extra two-month escrow reserve. \nI strongly suspect that this change is not driven by any legitimate need related to my loan or financial circumstances but rather by Wells Fargo 's internal financial motivations. It has come to my attention that Wells Fargo has faced challenges in attracting deposits due to its lack of competitive interest rates, leading many customers to migrate their funds to institutions offering better returns. Given this situation, it appears that Wells Fargo is now attempting to generate additional deposits that can earn interest to support its operations. \nI find this behavior reprehensible, especially in a time when interest rates are historically high, and mortgage holders like me are unable to easily switch banks due to the associated costs and complexities. This arbitrary modification to my escrow account, seemingly driven by Wells Fargo 's financial concerns rather than a legitimate reason related to my loan, is not only unfair but also appears to be a breach of trust. \nI believe that Wells Fargo 's actions may not only be impacting me but also countless other customers facing similar issues. This situation could potentially lead to class actions and lawsuits against the bank. I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter thoroughly to ensure that Wells Fargo is held accountable for its actions and that it complies with all relevant fair practices and market conduct expectations. \nI demand that Wells Fargo removes the new unnecessary non interest bearing two month reserve from my escrow or provides me with a comprehensive and written response explaining the rationale behind their decision to add a two-month reserve to my escrow account now, as opposed to including this provision in the Truth-in-Lending Disclosure of my mortgage agreement a decade ago when I initially chose Wells Fargo as my mortgage provider . I specifically elected to go with Wells Fargo based on the understanding that this additional reserve would be part of our agreement, and I need a clear explanation as to what has changed since then to warrant this unexpected modification. \nI am grateful for your attention to this matter and your commitment to protecting consumers ' rights.

At my visit to branch # XXXX in XXXX, CA, I was the only customer at the branch. I found out that my ATM card was expired, I requested from the teller employee at the window to order my replacement ATM card, the employee requested help from the BRANCH MANAGER, who, after looking at my account, told me that he can not order the ATM card from his computer and that in order for me to order a new card, I MUST MAKE AN APPOINTMENT AND SIT WITH A BANKER. He then proceeded to tell me that no appointments are available soon, but he can put me on a waiting list and get me to meet a banker faster than making an appointment. which I found it ODD because I have been with Wells Fargo for more than 35 years and I have renewed my ATM cards before at the teller window. \nUsually, they want you to sit with a banker to try to convince you to open more accounts that you do not need and to make investments that profit the bankers. \nI want from Wells Fargo answers to my questions, to verify if Wells Fargo is turning to a circus or is it still a financial institution 1- WHY THE MANAGER AT THE BRANCH TOLD ME THAT I NEED AN APPOINTMENT TO SIT WITH A BANKER JUST TO RENEW MY ATM CARD? It must be a hidden reason behind it that benefits the banker. \n2- DOES THIS MANAGER THINK I AM STUPID TO TELL ME THAT HE CAN NOT RENEW MY ATM CARD ON HIS COMPUTER? \n3- HOW COME WHEN I WENT OUTSIDE OF THE BRANCH AND CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE XXXX THE CUSTOMER SERVICE RENEWED MY CARD IN 30 SECOND PHONE CALL? \n4- WHY THE MANAGER OF THE BRANCH DOES NOT HAVE EXPERIENCE AND DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO RENEW AN ATM CARD? \n5- WHY THIS BRANCH MANAGER DID NOT TELL ME THAT I CAN ORDER THE REPLACEMENT ATM CARD ONLINE AND OVER THE PHONE? \n6- IS WELLS FARGO HIRING MANAGERS FOR THE BRANCHES WITH NO EXPERIENCE SIMILAR TO THE ONES WHO ANSWER MY COMPLAINT AND THE ONE WHO TOLD ME HE CAN NOT RENEW MY ATM CARD ON HIS COMPUTER? \n7- WHY WELLS FARGO IS REFUSING TO INVESTIGATE THIS POSSIBLE MISCONDUCT? \nI am not getting answers to my questions even after re-submitting my complaint more than 10 times in the last 4 months because Wells Fargo contracted the customer service duty to a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ). This company XXXX employes are without any banking experience to resolve the customer 's issues, Those employees are labeled XXXX.are Working from the comfort of their homes without any supervision and NOT under the Wells Fargo management they are independent contractors. their responses are just a copy and paste of generic replies that they send to everyone or a vague response as the response I received for complaint # XXXX The XXXX  working from the comfort of their home Refused to address my complaint properly and they switch the case from a case against the MANAGER to a case against the window teller employee or about opening a new account or about checking and saving or about lack of appointments which I am not complaining about. Those Employees of the contractors XXXX, refused to forward my complaint to a REAL Wells Fargo manager, and refused to answer and investigate my complaint. \nI was told in writing by the Wells Fargo 's contractors XXXX  that Wells Fargo has no email or website for online complaints and has no managers or supervisors and that was confirmed by the last response of the XXXX  XXXX as they think they are the highest level in Wells Fargo or they are the God ay Wells Fargo and no magers above them. So the Customers like me find no REAL Wells Fargo site to complain but here. \nNotice : because in my experience, Wells Fargo Employees do not tell the truth. You can reviews the security cameras at the branch to verify that the branch was empty of customers except myself and 4 tellers at the windows had nothing to do and the manager was telling jokes to the employees.

The Wells Fargo working from the comfort of their home employees do not read my complaint they only copy and paste standard answers and mail it to my resident when in my complaints I provided the po box as my mailing address and I did not provide my residential address and my account mailing preference is my po box . \nWells Fargo is refusing to address my issue properly, Wells Fargo is refusing to investigate, Wells Fargo is refusing to follow the rules and regulations regarding my account mailing preference, and they send misleading answers and they do not even read my complaint before they answer it, The people who answer the complaints for Wells Fargo are labeled XXXX, Those are inexperienced people who are NOT WELLS FARGO EMPLOYEES, they are working for the contractor XXXX  from the comfort of their homes without any supervision not under Wells Fargo 's Management. \nI tried to speak to a manager or supervisor, but I was told that Wells Fargo employees who answer the complaint are working from their homes and there have no way to connect me to a manager or supervisor because they are independent contractors, they do not work under the supervision of Wells Fargo bank they are working for the XXXX XXXX. \nSo, after 3 years of complaints to Wells Fargo and everywhere, where they have authority over Wells Fargo and after more than 105 complaints, Wells Fargo still did not address my issue properly and did not solve it and Wells Fargo is still denying me the right of privacy when I do not want the bank to send the mail to my resident. and Wells Fargo is still refusing to use my po box mailing address as it is indicated on my account preference. \nI have tons of letters from Wells Fargo as evidence that they are mailing to my residential address, especially the 3 letters from the XXXX called XXXX XXXX who mailed it to my resident. \nThe misleading Wells Fargo excuses for not using my po box . are : The US Patriot Act, Covid-19, The weather, The difference in time, The expansion of Wells Fargo overseas and so on. \nBottom line, It seems that Wells Fargo DOES NOT have a customer service department, they have a subcontractor, it seems Wells Fargo is going down soon, and the Wells Fargo management knows it, this is why they are not putting any effort in managing Wells Fargo, they are letting it go bankrupt.and they are accepting an ( F ) by XXXX XXXX XXXX", "answer": "#### Checking or savings account"}, {"question": "I did a balance transfer to US bank credit card while back by a paying fee and received the XXXX percent interest offer which is scheduled to expire on XX/XX/XXXX.

When I called the customer service at US bank, they told me any payments I make would go towards paying off any balance with lower interest rates first and there's nothing they can do about it.

During the waiting period, I noticed that the payment was not reflected on my XXXX card, but the Citi card reflected the amount. I called Citi to see why my payment had not been posted to my XXXX card and was told to wait a few more days. I questioned the representative to ensure that the right card had been paid. The representative asked for my XXXX 's card number and reassured me everything was fine. Well, I waited a few more days and called back into Citi and spoke with a different representative who asked for my card number again. The representative then informed me that the card number I had given didn't match the one that was paid. I asked how is that possible when I had just reached out to a representative who reassured me the right card had been paid. I explained that I use the mobile app to do the balance transfer by taking a snapshot of my XXXX card as requested by their system. However, I hadn't noticed that some numbers had changed due to the number being blocked out. The rep stated a case would be open, but it was too late to recall the balance transfer which I had requested early on, but was told it would be fine. A week had passed so I reached back out to Citi to see if any progress had been made, I was told they would need to reach out to XXXX. I received a letter in the mail stating the case is now with XXXX and given a trace number for the payment. I then reached out to XXXX only to learn that Citi could not speak with them without me being on the call and they would open their own investigation. XXXX gave me a temporary credit but removed the credit on XX/XX/XXXX because the trace number provided by Citi was considered invalid. I then reached back out to Citi, who opened another case and once again I was sent the same letter stating information was sent over to XXXX along with a trace number. The trace number sent was the same trace number I was previously provided. I decided once again to call Citi and have XXXX on the phone at the same time. The XXXX 's rep explained that there was nothing that could be done on their end because that trace number was invalid and they recalled the payment altogether. The Citi rep said sorry we can't do and there is nothing that can be done going forward. I have since opened another investigation with hopes this can be resolved, so far I have received the same response when calling. I was even told I would get a provisional credit until the issue was resolved ( Citi ). There is still no provisional credit just two high balances. Today 's billing representative said to give it until the end of the week to get resolved before calling back.

The available credit in our checking account on XXXX was {$7600.00}. Please see the attached copy of my checking account statement. We also chave a \" confirmation of payment '' from Citibank on XXXX that States \" we received the {$6400.00} payment and credited the Costco Anywhere XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. It also goes on to state we have a remaining balance of {$0.00}. The confirmation number for this transaction is XXXX. A copy of this confirmation from Citibank is attached. I have also attached a copy of my credit card statement showing, on page XXXX, that a payment in the amount of {$6400.00} was credited to our account on XXXX. \n\nOn XXXX we received a text alerting us of a NSF transaction. We immediately called Citibank to see what this was about since we have never received an alert of this kind before. The XXXX at Citibank, XXXX, explained that apparently the payment we made on the XXXX did not go through because there were not enough funds. My husband then recalls making the payment on XXXX and then the next day transferring, funds he believed to be his paycheck back to our savings account. My husband knew Citibank had taken their money on XXXX so what he saw had to be his paycheck which he was expecting and was coincadentally around the same dollar amount. Apparently, after speaking to XXXX, we realized they did not in fact take out the funds on XXXX as the confirmation stated. They actually attempted to take the funds on the XXXX. XXXX said this was a matter of hours and there should not be a fee but if there is that it would or could be reversed. We thought that was the end until we looked at our account on XXXX and noticed they had posted a NSF fee in the amount of {$41.00} to our account. Once we saw this we called into the bank to let them know of our previous conversation with XXXX and how he had stated this fee would be removed. This is when what we thought would be a XXXX min. XXXX turned into the worst experience we have ever had with any company. \n\nThe first XXXX wet spoke with put us on a brief hold after we explained what had happened and what XXXX had told us on XXXX. She returned to the line to tell us she could not reverse the fee because it was not bank error. She did not care what XXXX had told us and stood her ground. So, I asked to speak to her supervisor. Again, I naively thought it would end here for sure but I could not have been more wrong. I spoke to XXXX and she stated the same thing as the previous rep. They refused to reverse the {$41.00} fee because it was a valid charge in their eyes. At this point I started to get really mad. This conversation has already taken longer than it needed to. I asked to speak to her supervisor. She said she was as far as I could go. I told her I know darn well you are not anywhere near the top of the food chain. I know, 100 %, that you have a supervisor I can talk to. She then, miraculously, produced her supervisor. This is when it gets even more ridiculous. \n\nXXXX an officer of the bank as he called himself got on the phone. At this level, I was sure this was going to come to a speedy end. Nope, I was wrong again. XXXX immediately put me on hold to see what he could do. He came back and said there was no way he could reverse the fee. I am livid at this point. He has the audacity to tell me that if I wanted to escalate this further I would have to write a letter. So, he wanted me to waste more of my time writing a letter about a {$41.00} fee I was wrongly charged AND was already told would be reversed. I began to explain to XXXX the entire situation and how there was money in the account when it was paid and accepted by your bank. He told me that they tried to take the money on the XXXX but there was no money but when they tried a second time it went thorough. He said they will attempt it XXXX times. On a side note, I asked him why would you charge an NSF fee if the money goes through on any of those XXXX attempts? This is not right, I told him. He said it is because the bank charges Citibank each time they try to ping the account. He then told me if I could get my bank to write a letter stating it was their error and the money was indeed there on XXXX then they could reverse the fee. I told him that there is no way I am going to waste even more time going into my bank. The fact that I was still on this call was mind blowing. I flat out told him, numerous times, that I should have been off this call in XXXX minutes. I have been a customer for 17 years. I have always paid my bills on time and never once have had an NSF ( on any bill for that matter ). I also have always paid our bills off in full every month. I told him this fee should have been waived immediately without hesitation, as a courtesy, given my stellar history with your bank. That fell on deaf ears because he just continued to ramble on about how it was a valid fee. He could care less about my business. It does not affect his bottom line as a customer service rep. \n\nEarlier in our conversation he had stated if I could get my bank to state that there were enough funds in the account on XXXX then he could reverse the fee. So, I said why dont you call my bank right now and ask them. He agreed and called XXXX XXXX. The first XXXX was XXXX. XXXX confirmed there was in fact {$7600.00} in the account on XXXX. However, XXXX began to change his tune and state that yes it XXXX have been pending but it did not clear until the XXXX. I told him if it was pending then that is proof there were funds when it was pinged. If there were no funds when it first pinged on the XXXX then it would have bounced then. I was beyond mad by this point. I told him that I had just met his requirements, that there were funds in the account when they pinged sit the first time and my bank just confirmed this. He just kept repeating how it did not clear on the XXXX though. He said some banks it clears right then and some it takes a few days. He then tried to tell me again to go into the bank and have them write a letter. I asked him what are these magic words you want to hear from them that will allow you to reverse this fee? He asked my bank rep if they had any branches in my area. There are no Citibank or XXXX XXXX branches anywhere near me. I then asked to talk to XXXX supervisor to see if we can get whatever it is XXXX wants to hear. \n\nThe supervisor at XXXX XXXX was XXXX. I began to ask for times these transactions were occurring. She said Citibank did not attempt to pull funds until XXXX at XXXX XXXX. She said they did not attempt anything on the XXXX. I found this very interesting because this entire time XXXX has said that they first attempted on the XXXX. Also, all my documentation states it was credited to my account on XXXX. XXXX then told us that we transferred out $ back to savings, thinking this was his paycheck and knowing he had already paid Citicard the day before, at XXXX XXXX  on XXXX. \n\nSo, I told him then this actually is a bank error and he needed to reverse the fee. All my documentation shows it crediting on the XXXX but they didnt even attempt it until XXXXXXXX XXXX on XXXX. He still refused and continued to state he was the highest level I could speak to and if I had a further complaint then I needed to send it in writing. I also pointed out the fact that my bank did not charge me an NSF fee. XXXX said that is a good point and asked XXXX why that was. She stated I supposedly have an account that does not get charged fees. At this time it was clear to me that he was not going to reverse this fee regardless what proof I presented. \n\nI told him I hope he gets reprimanded or fired for this.

Two days after arriving in country I finally had cell service to receive a voicemail from US Bank regarding card fraud. I called the US Bank XXXX number and was told two days after I arrived in country for XXXX that my credit card was used to make a {$10.00} purchase at XXXX XXXX  in the state of Georgia ( I reside in XXXX state ) . \nOn the XXXX call around XXXX XXXX  I explained to the representative that I am XXXX in a foreign country and this card is the form of funding I brought with me and the billing card for all of my autopay bills in the US while I am gone. I asked her to see if the bank could do anything about NOT cutting my card off. She understood my situation and put me on hold. She came back approximately 5-10 minutes later letting me know she spoke with the fraud team and they approved NOT cutting my card off due to my situation, but to monitor my account and call back ASAP if other fraudulent charges appear. \nLess than 30 minutes after getting off of the phone with this first representative and extremely happy they did not cut off my only personal card overseas and my billing card for everything back home, I received a notification from my XXXX XXXX saying the card was no longer active. \nApproximately XXXX XXXX  on the same date, I called back to ask why my card was cut off when I was just told they would keep it on due to my XXXX circumstances. The representative this time said they can not keep my card on and policy would only be to extend the card for 10 days. She was not sure why I was told my card would stay active but that it has been cut off and a new card number was issued. She let me know there was no way to reactivate the previous card at this time. I made sure to explain that I am XXXX for 6 months and now without a card. I requested a new card be sent to my residential address in XXXX ( different from my home address on file ) so that my spouse could either verbally give me the numbers to change all of my autopay bills at least OR be able to send the physical card with our last remaining group deploying and coming to the same country as me this week. She assured me the card had been ordered to my correct address and would arrive by XXXX. \nOn XXXX at approx XXXX PST and XXXX at approx XXXX XXXX  I called to check on the card as my spouse confirmed it had not yet arrived at my home address. Both times I was told it is still en route to your home and due to it being the weekend I should \" give it until tomorrow ''. I was told both times by different representatives that if I did not see it by XXXX the next day to call back. Both ladies noted there was no tracking number due to the card being sent by USPS but they could see that it was labeled as shipped to my Washington address. On one of these calls they read the notes and told me \" someone called and was mad the card got cut off '' and I explained yes I was upset that I am out of the country for 6 months with no card and was told they would keep the card active only to have it shut off in 30 minutes. On the XXXX call I was told at one point that the card had been marked received and activated. \nI harped on the fact that we had one more group of individuals coming to the same country as me and that my spouse would have the chance to give someone my card to bring me if it was received this week. This was very important to the shipping date of the card and the fact it was supposed to be there on XXXX. No one could provide a tracking number throughout any of the phone calls. \nMy final call on XXXX I explained all of the above conversations to the representative. She pulled up the account and said NO CARD WAS EVER SENT. I continued to ask if there was no card sent then how are these other representatives telling me dates it would arrive, confirming it was shipped to my residential address ( again different than on file ), and that it is in the mail but must be delayed. She apologized and said the process was started but the card was never sent after the first call because I \" could not receive mail ''. This was NEVER a topic of conversation as I had asked from the very first call after cutting off my card that it was sent to my residential address where my spouse can receive it. I never asked for the card to be mail to me out of country as it would take months and potentially never get here at all. \nAfter my final phone call on XXXX I received a confirmation email approximately 10 minutes later that a new card was ordered.\n\nIt took 7 days and 5 different customer service reps to finally determine my card had NEVER been shipped. Not a single one of these representatives understood the urgency and importance of getting a card to my spouse in order to send it with our next group shipping out. In the last 7 days I have had notifications from multiple utilities and companies that my Autopay bills were denied because of this situation. I have immaculate credit and now am receiving unpaid bill notices due to US Banks carelessness.\n\nI have been a loyal US Bank customer for 20+ years, however, due to the mishandling of this situation, when returning home from this XXXX I will be changing banks to ensure this situation never happens again. \nPLEASE do retraining with your customer service reps.

My previous dentist did not take my insurance, XXXX XXXX and so I was looking for a new dentist. I found XXXX XXXX XXXX when I was driving around XXXX. At the time, due to the need for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I was in extreme pain and was seeking assistance as soon as possible. I went in as a walk-in appointment to XXXX XXXX XXXX that same day. \n\nWhen I went into XXXX XXXX XXXX for assistance, I informed them that I have XXXX insurance coverage. While I was in the procedure room and in the examination chair, the dentist informed me that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not take my insurance. The dentist then stated that since they did not take my insurance, they wanted to see if I qualified for credit. The dentist did not specify XXXX XXXX, nor did she provide me with an estimate of how much the procedure would cost. The dentist then left the room, leaving me in the procedure chair. When she returned, she stated that I qualified for a {$3000.00} credit line with XXXX XXXX.

I called XXXX XXXX XXXX  and requested that they remedy the situation, and XXXX XXXX XXXX informed me to come back in for a third appointment. That same day, I went back to the XXXX XXXX XXXX, and they did an Xray of my teeth. At that point, the dentist stated that they would have to remove my molar next to the filling. I stated that I did not want to get rid of a perfectly fine tooth. The dentist stated that removing the tooth would fix the gap issue in my filling. I expressed concern and stated that her suggestion did not make sense as to how removing a molar would fix the gap in my current tooth because it would make the area bigger. The dentist from XXXX XXXX XXXX stated that if I was not willing to remove the molar, there was nothing else she could do, and they refused to assist me further. \n\nAfter the third appointment, I received the XXXX XXXX  card in the mail. A few days after the card came in the mail, I received the first bill to the XXXX XXXX  card. This was the first time I learned about the cost of the procedure and the balance of the debt. Upon seeing the balance, I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX by phone to dispute charge of the credit card. I informed XXXX XXXX associates by phone that the procedure was not done properly and there was still a gap in your tooth. XXXX XXXX informed me that they would investigate. I reached out multiple times via phone to follow up on the investigation, however, I did not receive evidence of an investigation nor results from said investigations. \n\nXXXX XXXX XXXX  charged me for dental work that was improperly done and entirely unbeneficial to me.

After many months, ISL finally sent a SECOND 1099c it listed the identifiable event as XXXX XXXX  - a discharge of indebtedness under agreement between the creditor and debtor. To be able to appropriately address tax liability I have requested a copy of the agreement that triggered this event. ISL/Aspire refuses to provide such documentation and also refuses to update the 1099c to correct the identifiable event because no settlement agreement exists. After filing a prior CFPB complaint about this issue, Aspire provided the following response : XXXX XXXX signed a promissory note and agreed to the terms as outlined in the credit agreement when she applied for the private education loans. Copies of the signed promissory notes and credit agreements were sent to XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/2018 notifying her that the balance on the loans had been written off, but we are resending them directly to her again along with a copy of this response. The credit agreements were issued under Iowa law, and they clearly identify the provisions for default. Under Iowa law, the statute of limitations for collecting on unpaid debt that stems from a written contract is 10 years. Because payments were not received from XXXX XXXX in that time period, the debt went out of statute. As a result, Aspire Servicing Center wrote off the loans on XX/XX/2018. At that time, the IRS required the issuance of the 1099-C. The 1099-C was provided to both the IRS and XXXX XXXX for the XXXX  tax reporting season.

Introduction : I hereby submit a formal complaint against TransUnion for XXXX discrimination, retaliation, bank fraud, wire fraud, and violations of the RICO Act, infringing upon my rights under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ), the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), and other pertinent federal laws. \n\nIII. Active Complaints with FBI, FTC, and CFPB : This grievance is not isolated. The FBI, FTC, and CFPB have active complaints regarding similar issues with TransUnion, highlighting a pattern of potentially illegal practices by the company. \n\nIV. Allegations of Bank Fraud, Wire Fraud, and RICO Violations : Bank Fraud : I have reasons to believe that TransUnion has knowingly engaged in deceptive practices to defraud banks or other financial institutions, which is a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1344.\n\nWire Fraud : TransUnion is suspected of using interstate wire communications to defraud consumers, violating 18 U.S.C. 1343. Their actions have not only harmed my financial standing but have also illegally profited by using deceptive practices. \nRICO Violations : TransUnions actions suggest a pattern of racketeering activity. By accepting financial incentives for reporting, they may be in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ( RICO ) Act, specifically 18 U.S.C. 1961-1968. \nV. XXXX Discrimination : TransUnion has not only failed to unlock my credit report despite numerous requests but also appears to be discriminating against me based on my race, violating the ECOA. \n\nVI. Retaliation : Their refusal to address previous complaints and unlock my credit report seems retaliatory for filing federal complaints, violating principles of fairness and justice. \n\nVII. Discrepancies with Other Credit Bureaus : Other credit bureaus, namely XXXX and XXXX, have adhered to federal laws by deleting inaccurate information from my credit reports. TransUnions refusal to do the same raises serious concerns about their practices.\n\nVIII. Legal Action : If these issues remain unaddressed, I intend to escalate this matter legally, seeking remedies for the harm inflicted upon me due to racial discrimination, bank fraud, wire fraud, and RICO violations.\n\nIX. Conclusion : I urge the CFPB and DOJ to investigate these serious allegations against TransUnion. Their practices have caused significant harm and warrant thorough examination and intervention by your esteemed agencies. \n\nI anticipate your prompt attention to this grave matter.", "answer": "#### Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports"}, {"question": "I have called the agencies like NetSpend and go to bank and the XXXX banking and they all tell me that they don't have me on file but I know I've had open bank accounts like my money was transferred or something cuz there's two accounts closed with NetSpend but they would not tell me any information I don't understand because someone stole my identity and it has been difficult ever since to keep my money and everything safe I set up direct deposit but it seems like someone has changed my information again I just got a NetSpend card in the mail and I don't know why please help me thank you", "answer": "#### Checking or savings account"}, {"question": "FBNO accessed my credit report when I applied for a card.

We reside in XXXX, Florida, which was XXXX XXXX for Hurricane Ian in XX/XX/XXXX ; nearly a category 5 storm. As fully documented in the press, the damage to our area was very significant, and our home was no exception. Specifically, our home suffered over {$500000.00} in actual damages, including extensive roof damage, water leakage throughout the inside of the home, and black mold infestation. Following this devastating storm, we lost all power for over two weeks and had no running water or air conditioning. While we have a public adjuster working on our insurance claims, given the extensive damage and volume of claims, it may be months or years before we receive any insurance money to complete the needed repairs if ever. Apparently, a number of insurance companies in Florida have been closed by the State due to insufficient reserves. Prior to this unfortunate set of events completely out of our control, we paid our mortgage on time to our servicer, SPS every month via XXXXXXXX XXXX. In fact, from the inception of our loan, we never missed any payments and always paid on time or in advance. My wife and I work in the real estate industry, and when XXXX XXXX devastated our area, all our real estate transactions came to a standstill. Quite simply, nobody wanted to purchase hurricane damaged homes, and sellers did not list their homes because they wouldnt receive fair market value without first repairing the damage. As such, we had no income for months after the storm, and were unable to make any mortgage payments. On XX/XX/XXXX, the Governor of Florida issued Executive Order XXXX renewing the XXXX XXXX State of Emergency , a state of emergency originally declared on XX/XX/XXXX, for an additional 60 days. In view of the foregoing, we requested reasonable assistance from SPS to either provide a reasonable forbearance period, defer any missed payments to the end of the loan, and send us a new payment amount that would allow us to catch up over a reasonable time period. We actually applied for assistance from SPS through their online in XX/XX/XXXX. From that point forward, SPS requested additional information fourteen ( 14 ) different times as per our conversation log with our servicer. At least half of the requests were asking for the same information already sent, which suggests that SPS either lost the information initially sent, or one hand doesnt know what the other is doing internally at SPS . On at least 3 occasions, SPS sent a specialist to our home to prepare a broker price opinion and valuation. It was not until XX/XX/XXXX, months after we initiated this process, that SPS finally sent us a letter stating they rejected our request for any modification or forbearance of our loan, and demanded that we pay the past due balance of {$83000.00} by no later than XX/XX/XXXX or SPS would initiate a foreclosure process. See attached letter. We communicated with SPS through our attorneys office, and confirmed that SPS and the investor on this loan refused to even review our modification application. It is clear from these facts that our servicer did not review our loan modification application in good faith or with genuine intent to review our file for loss mitigation. It is clear that our family suffered real and significant hardship which justifies, at a minimum, a good faith loss mitigation review. Our servicer clear refusal to afford us that request is a clear and direct violation of CFPB guidelines. All we request is a meaningful and good faith review of our loss mitigation application, rather than a blanket denial without review. If SPS is unwilling to provide our family a simple good faith loss mitigation review, we request appropriate penalties and sanctions be imposed by the CFPB that prevents SPS and other similarly situated servicers from engaging in bad faith loss mitigation practices in order to deprive homeowners of their right to retain their home. Please initiate a formal complaint against our servicer for these acts, and kindly open an investigation to determine if SPS is engaging in systematic deprivation of rights to homeowners like ourselves who have suffered genuine and significant hardships in connection with their home loans. \n\nWe applied again with SPS and provided all documents they requested except the taxes. We didn't file XXXX taxes yet and we have until XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX as per IRS special extension due to the hurricanes we kept getting as per FEMA rules.

Something I didnt like so I called many times to complain about it. You finally sent me the paperwork, I signed it, and returned it back to you ON TIME. Still my account was not release to allow me to set up autopay. I called again and I was made aware that TRUIST made a mistake on the calculation of my monthly payment, and that they were going to send me new documents for my signature. There was nothing I could do about that so I said ok to it and waited months to get it.

Meanwhile, I had called on XX/XX/XXXX to make a payment and inquire about this same document, but I was told a certain department is making a correction on it and will send it when they are done. All this can be verified by looking at the notes on my account. I called my wife who is currently at my residence in Virginia but she said she never received any package. I stayed in constant contact with TRUIST to get this issue resolved but was told that they were going to request that I get put back on the program since this was not due to my fault.

These issues disproportionately affect veterans, touching upon various aspects of the card and its payment options, potentially violating key laws designed to protect military members. \n\nDiscrimination Against Veterans : The AAFES Military Star Credit Card imposes restrictions on online payments, phone payments, and auto-pay for all members who have missed a payment. These restrictions remain in effect until a member has made six consecutive on-time payments. This restriction extends to all members, including veterans. However, this situation indirectly discriminates against veterans because in-store payment options are located on military installations, and access to these installations requires government certification, which many veterans do not possess. The process to obtain this certification for the sole purpose of making a payment is an unreasonable expectation and further discriminates veterans. \nBill-Pay Delays and Unfair Responsibility : Due to the restrictions on online and phone payments, veterans are left with only two options, one of which is a feature called Bill-Pay utilizing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX . The concerning aspect of Bill-Pay is that it delays the subtraction of funds from the member 's account for up to three weeks after the initiation of payment. While AAFES Military Star Card backdates the payment to reflect when it was initiated, this still places an unfair responsibility on veterans, especially those facing financial struggles and living paycheck to paycheck. The delayed subtraction of funds from a member 's account can lead to NSF fees, resulting in more financial stress and even bounced payments. It is unreasonable to expect members to track a payment initiated three weeks prior. The delay in fund subtraction, especially when both AAFES and XXXX have the means to backdate payments, suggests that they are aware of the issue and the burden it places on members. \nMail Payments as a Limited Option : The second payment option for veterans is mail, which, as the sole alternative means of payment, is subject to loss, delay, and even theft. This becomes even more problematic when there are only two payment options available for veterans, making it an unfair and illogical expectation for them. \nViolation of Laws : These restrictions on auto-pay, online payments, and phone payments, especially for XXXX service members with late payments, potentially violate several laws, including the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act ( SCRA ), Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act ( USERRA ), Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), and Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). \nContinued Lack of Adequate Response : In my prior complaint ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ), I outlined three key proposals for resolution, which I believe remain unchanged and fair : All veterans and members should have unrestricted access to make online payments and utilize auto-pay features, regardless of previous late payments. \nThe negative remarks on my credit report should be reversed, with similar consideration extended to other veterans or XXXX service members facing comparable issues. \nIn light of the treatment I have received from lending agencies and landlords due to the negative marks on my credit report before any potential reversal, I am requesting {$25000.00} as compensation for the hardships endured. \nI want to emphasize the urgency and importance of addressing these issues. Veterans should not face undue challenges when making payments or experience discrimination due to their military service status. I kindly request your intervention to thoroughly investigate this matter and guide AAFES to take necessary steps to address these concerns, ensuring compliance with laws meant to protect military members and providing an equitable experience for all cardholders. \n\nAdditionally, I would like to highlight the lack of adequate response to my previous complaint, both through the old case number and my emails. Despite providing clear details, my concerns remain unaddressed, and my proposals for resolution remain unacknowledged. \n\nI appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a prompt and just resolution to these ongoing issues.", "answer": "#### Credit card"}, {"question": "I checked my credit report on XXXX XXXX as I do annually just to make sure information on there is correct.

It has come to my attention that there have been serious legal and ethical violations in the execution of this agreement, which necessitates immediate action to rectify the situation. \n\nFirst and foremost, I must assert that I never received any monetary funds from Credit Acceptance Corporation as stipulated in the retail installment contract. No checks or funds were disbursed to me for the purpose of purchasing the vehicle in question. This raises serious concerns about the legitimacy of the contract and the actions taken by Credit Acceptance Corporation. \n\nUpon further investigation, it has become clear that Credit Acceptance Corporation engaged in fraudulent misrepresentation by acting under the color of law. I was led to believe that I was signing a contract to obtain a loan for the vehicle, when in reality, I unknowingly signed a contract as a surety or accommodation party. This fraudulent inducement deprived me of the opportunity to make an informed decision and violated my rights as a consumer. \n\nBy creating a fraudulent debt in my public name, Credit Acceptance Corporation has engaged in a form of identity theft, which is a serious offense under UCC 3.419. This action has caused significant distress and financial harm to me. I demand that you immediately cease all collection efforts related to this fraudulent debt and take immediate steps to rectify the situation.\n\nTherefore, I request the following actions be taken : 1. Return of Vehicle : I demand the immediate return of the vehicle that was unlawfully obtained from me. The vehicle 's details are as follows : - Make XXXX XXXX XXXX Model : XXXX - XXXX - Vehicle Identification Number ( VIN ) XXXX XXXX. Refund of Funds : I insist on a full refund of any and all funds that Credit Acceptance Corporation has received from me, as I did not receive any monetary funds as per the terms of the contract. \n\n3. Cessation of Collection Efforts : I expect that all collection efforts related to the fraudulent debt associated with this contract are immediately halted. This includes contacting me, reporting the debt to credit bureaus, or engaging any third-party debt collectors. \n\n4. Acknowledgment of Liability : I demand that Credit Acceptance Corporation formally acknowledge its liability for the fraudulent actions and misrepresentations that have occurred in relation to this contract.\n\nI expect a prompt response to this letter and a resolution to this matter within 30days from the date of your receipt of this correspondence. Failure to comply with these demands may leave me with no choice but to pursue legal remedies available to me, which may include filing complaints with regulatory authorities and seeking legal representation to protect my rights.\n\nPlease be advised that I have retained copies of all relevant documentation, including the retail installment contract, for my records and potential future legal proceedings.\n\nI trust that Credit Acceptance Corporation will take this matter seriously and act promptly to rectify the injustices that have been committed.

This complaint concerns multiple aspects of their conduct, including inconsistent and delayed closing disclosures, a refusal to provide crucial financial information before closing, and recurring errors in calculating closing costs, among other matters. \n\nI am a hardworking public service employee that has worked hard to save up for buying a house. Also I have zero knowledge or experience in real estate. That been said I like to provide a comprehensive account of the situation, I will outline the sequence of events that have transpired : On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a conventional mortgage loan to purchase a condo from Lennar Homes, who had advertised an attractive mortgage offer with a lower interest rate of XXXX XXXX and a promise of {$10000.00} in closing cost assistance for their XXXX  project in XXXX XXXX XXXX \n\nDuring the approval process, Lennar Mortgage informed me that in order to qualify for the loan, they would need to lower the interest rate to XXXX XXXX. I agreed to pay the difference in points costs to facilitate this change, but they offered to cover the cost themself and we signed a specific agreement to this effect. \n\nI received pre-approval for the mortgage and subsequently signed a purchase agreement on XX/XX/XXXX, with the initial closing date set for XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, due to various issues and inadequacies in Lennar Homes ' and Lennar Mortgage 's business practices, we were unable to close on XX/XX/XXXX. The closing date was extended to XX/XX/XXXX, but I faced obstacles caused by them and were unable to close due to the same issues. \n\nThe closing date has now been set for XX/XX/XXXX. However, I have been informed by the lender that I am required to pay for a rate lock and the interest from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, even though the delays were not on my side. Furthermore, the seller has decided not to honor the signed agreement regarding the points to bring down the interest rate and lastly my agreed downpayment of XXXX now is required to be {$100000.00} or I will be in default and lose my deposit according to them. \n\n\nNow, I would like to detail the specific grievances that constitute my complaint against Lennar Homes and Lennar Mortgage : Inconsistent and Delayed Closing Disclosures and Lack of Transparency : Throughout the process leading up to the initial closing date, I received multiple closing disclosures ( approximately XXXX ) without any explanation for the changes. Each time a new Closing Disclosure ( CD ) was issued, the total closing cost differed from what had been initially agreed upon. Despite numerous attempts to rectify these discrepancies, the discrepancies persisted. Just one day before the initial closing, I received an updated CD that showed a cash-to-close amount {$7000.00} higher than agreed upon due to errors made by Lennar Mortgage. They did not mention these extra costs just a day before closing and they were expecting I would accept and go on with it but I refused to close on XX/XX/XXXX and therefore we agreed to extend it to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nLast-Minute Cost Increases and Refusal to Provide Closing Disclosure Before Closing Day : After missing the initial closing on XX/XX/XXXX, Lennar agreed to extend the closing date by another month, then to rectify their mistake the next day on XX/XX/XXXX they provided a corrected closing disclosure. However, despite my constant request, they failed to provide an updated CD three days prior to closing. A week before I asked for an updated CD because there were some minor changes in the prepaid section. Despite my constant request, Lennar did not provide what I asked for. It was only two days before the new closing date, after I formally requested a copy or indicated my intention to file a complaint, that they finally sent me an incomplete CD, which lacked crucial information. On the day I met with the notary to sign, I noticed the CD that he had for me to sign was entirely different from what I had received previously and most importantly it was also different from what we had agreed upon on the CD that was issued XX/XX/XXXX. These actions not only indicated an attempt to mislead me by not providing the accurate cost they intended to charge but also resulted in XXXX missing the closing once again. \n\nRecurring HOA Fee Calculation Errors As if these issues were not enough, after the second closing date, XXXX XXXX, I was informed that they had once again made an error in calculating the HOA fees. According to this new cost estimate, I would not qualify for the mortgage unless I provided a 20 % down payment, significantly higher than our original agreement. However, this issue had already surfaced at the beginning of the process as well. On XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, the loan officer reached out to me, acknowledging his mistake and mentioning that the new HOA fee amount of {$640.00} causes a critical factor in loan qualification. To meet the requirement according to the lender I had agreed to increase my down payment from {$69000.00} to {$71000.00}. Now after XXXX months they used same matter which seems fishy to raise my down payment from XXXX to XXXX This situation presented me with an ultimatum to provide additional funds or withdraw my application. \n\nI again agreed to pay a higher down payment draining all my retirement and saving accounts. Now, with a closing day set for XX/XX/XXXX, not only do I have to provide a much larger down payment, but I am also being compelled to pay fees to lock the rate and cover interest from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. They have refused to move the closing day to the end of the month, which would help reduce costs. They already have a deposit from me, and I fear that if I don't accept these conditions, I may risk losing my deposit. \n\n\nIn light of these ongoing issues, I am deeply concerned about the conduct of Lennar Homes and Lennar Mortgage, which might be in violation of established regulations and ethical standards. I kindly request that your office thoroughly investigate this matter to ensure that my rights as a consumer are upheld and that appropriate actions are taken to rectify the situation. \n\nFurthermore, I seek your assistance in resolving this matter promptly and ensuring that I am not unfairly burdened with fees and charges that result from the lender 's actions and delays beyond my control. \n\nPlease contact me if you need more details or supporting documents for the incidents mentioned in this complaint. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt and thorough investigation and resolution. \n\nSincerely,", "answer": "#### Mortgage"}, {"question": "I signed up for a US bank account in XX/XX/ under the XXXX  bonus.

These purchases were not made by me and were clearly the result of fraudulent activities from the same places and often times exact amount to the penny. I promptly contacted their customer service team to report the issue and requested that my card be closed to prevent further unauthorized transactions. \n\nFraudulent Check Deposits : On the same day, XX/XX/, I also discovered that fraudulent checks amounting to {$1500.00} were deposited into my credit card account. These checks were clearly fraudulent and should have been detected and blocked by their security systems. I immediately reported this issue as well, along with the unauthorized purchases, and requested that these funds be removed from my account. \n\nI was assured by their representatives that my credit card would be closed, the stolen funds would be refunded, and the fraudulent deposits would be removed from my account.

Phone calls often go unanswered, and when I do get through, I am frequently passed around to different representatives. They have no email or way to write to them. Despite reporting these issues two weeks ago, I have not received any information regarding the status of my report, why my credit card remains active to the fraudsters, or why I have not been refunded. \n\nI would like to request the following actions to be taken promptly : 1 ) Close my Verve credit card account immediately to prevent any further unauthorized transactions. \n\n2 ) Refund the total amount of unauthorized purchases, which amounts to {$2700.00}. \nRemove all fraudulent deposits from my credit card account, which currently stands at {$2000.00}. \n\n3 ) Improve the security measures in place to prevent any future unauthorized activities on my account, and others from this company. \n\n4 ) Provide clear and consistent communication regarding the status of my report and the resolution process. \n\n5 ) I expect that these issues are addressed promptly, and the necessary actions are taken to rectify the situation. \n\n6 ) Get compensated for the significant financial distress this has caused me Your swift attention to this matter is of the utmost importance as I suspect several others are affected by this company. \n\nSincerely,", "answer": "#### Credit card"}, {"question": "The existence of a derogatory rating on my account is causing me significant concern.

It is essential to note that prior to receiving this letter, I had initiated the application process with the Homeowner Assistance Fund ( HAF ) and the Arizona Department of Housing ( ADOH ) for mortgage assistance and assistance with the delinquent HOA debt. As part of the application process, I was required to provide documentation, including a statement from the condo, HOA, co-op, or other association showing the past due amount, to confirm a XXXX related hardship. During my conversation with XXXX XXXX, she informed me that she was unable to provide a payoff balance without serving me with a lawsuit, but she estimated it to be close to {$8800.00}. She mentioned that the exact amount would only be available after I was served, as all legal and filing fees needed to be calculated.

The representative alleged that I personally accessed the self-service portal and registered a new bank account and routing number. They further claimed that I used this unfamiliar payment method on XX/XX/XXXX ( This is an inaccurate and misleading assertion ) Where is the proof indicating that I input this information in that manner? The following day, on XX/XX/XXXX, I reverted to my standard method of making two distinct payments ( This fact was established due to my account status reflecting 126 days of overdue payments ). My advisor recommended maintaining my arrears under 120 days despite my account status being in dispute at the time. \n\nAfter completing the payments, I realized that I was no longer able to access the account, leading to a phone call on XX/XX/XXXX. During my discussion with the representative over the phone, I was informed, \" The account is now fully paid off and closed. '' I asked the representative to confirm this, and they did, stating that the account was indeed \" fully settled '' and that it was not merely reflecting as such. About an hour later, I reached out to Bridgecrest once more, this time via text, for further confirmation. Once again, I was assured that the account was \" officially closed and marked as fully paid. '' I was also told when to expect the release of the title, with the date being no later than XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, The reply from Bridgecrest 's agent response to the CFPB complaint on XX/XX/XXXX seems to be based on perceptions that the account is in a certain state, rather than the actual facts that the debt was completely cleared, but this is not depicted in the mailed transaction statements provided by Bridgecrest actual documentation. These statements unambiguously demonstrate that this account was paid in full. Moreover, evidence of manual adjustments to transactions I executed on XX/XX/XXXX is apparent. Bridgecrests agents response does not recognize that this account was closed then manually reopened ; instead, they assert that the account was never officially cleared but merely appears so in the application, which is an inaccurate assertion. If this were the case, the account should not present a clearedXX/XX/XXXX status on the transaction statement if the company verifies the funds ' definitive clearance before closing an account with a status of paid in full. \n\nBased on the transaction record supplied by Bridgecrest, it appears the expected repayment was not reversed on XX/XX/XXXX as alleged by the Bridgecrest representative in their CFPB response letter, but actually on XX/XX/XXXX, which is a misleading representation. It was also observed that the dates of my payments, initially made on XX/XX/XXXX, were subsequently altered and recorded as posted on XX/XX/XXXX. This alteration was done without my permission or knowledge following the prior confirmation that my account was fully settled, constituting deceptive conduct. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I unknowingly reached out to Bridgecrest once again inquiring whether they could electronically transfer the vehicle 's title due to its sale on the previous day, but my request was refused. The representative not only declined but also insulted me, labeling me \" XX/XX/XXXX ''. However, they acknowledged my account was \" fully paid and closed '', but indicated Bridgecrest 's intention to re-open it based on some unidentified payment issue. I promptly raised my objection, stating they had no permission from me to re-open the settled account. I warned them that such an action would constitute a breach of the law, even if the fault lay with Bridgecrest which would result in Promissory Estoppel. The call was then disconnected Bridgecrest 's representative 's response to the CFPB complaint suggested that a backend audit was underway. The audit demonstrated that the account balance was at \" XXXX '' and had indeed been \" Discharged '', reiterating that the business had reactivated the account without my consent or any form of communication. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX the same agent who addressed the CFPB complaint, reached out to me by phone. The motive for her call was to discuss previously withdrawn CFPB complaints, contrary to what was indicated in the written CFPB response on XX/XX/XXXX ( this account is false ). She tried to discuss account-related issues, but the call got cut off during her attempt, a violation of the pre-existing Cease and Desist order. I attempted to return her call to understand her concerns, but I didn't succeed as she didn't pick up ( Not as claimed by XXXX stating that I didn't respond - False Statement ). The Bridgecrest representative didn't make an effort to reconnect with me and didn't answer my call when I tried calling back ( four times ). \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, in the CFPB reply letter by XXXX XXXX states that, according to the agent, my account was reopened on XX/XX/XXXX without any prior notice or my approval. I realized on XX/XX/XXXX that the account was active again and promptly contacted Bridgecrest. The representative first attempted to argue that the account was never settled and closed but ultimately confessed that it had been closed and discharged. Revealing that someone had manually reopened the account, a non-compliant activity. I reiterated to him that this was done without my consent or knowledge. I also informed him that the car associated with this account had been sold as of XX/XX/XXXX urging him to close my account immediately with a paid in full status and to notate on the account. Which shows false statement made by XXXX XXXX. \n\nBridgecrest 's rebuttal to the CFPB complaint also purportedly includes an assertion that I claimed bankruptcy. That is incorrect, I never made such a declaration ( Inaccurate Statement ). Given that I was unable to make contact with a customer service representative, I communicated with the Bankruptcy department and was then forwarded to a representative who informed me that my account was Manually reinstated. Bridgecrest 's representative 's response to the CFPB complaint is additionally deceptive, alleging that the account and payment history were discussed with me, which they were not ( Inaccurate Statement ). We only talked about the transactions that i confirmed I executed on XX/XX/XXXX and the unknown payment made on XX/XX/XXXX, which I was distinctly unaware of, a fact I highlighted to the representative on our phone conversation on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, the representative from Brigcrest responded to the CFPB complaint, stating that on XX/XX/XXXX the account had been charged off due to \" non-payment '' which was within nine days of the acceptance of payments made on XX/XX/XXXX. I was not informed about any decision to \" write off '' or alter the status of the account ( Erroneous Claim and Retaliatory Approach ). The account was noted on XX/XX/XXXX and was active until XX/XX/XXXX, which is when the account status reverted to the previous \" Closed '' status. \n\nIn the complaint response made to the CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX, the Bridgecrest representative asserted that she had tried to contact me once more on XX/XX/XXXX ( Deceptive Declaration and Cease and Desist Infringement ). The Bridgecrest agent 's assertions of accuracy are not my responsibility. As the Bridgecrest agent mentioned in the response to the CFPB complaint, I have submitted several notification letters through fax and Certified Mail without receiving any reply for my requests such as ( Validation Letter Request ( 1 ) ( 2 ), Notice of Insufficient Validation Documentation, Cease and Desist, Notice of Dispute, Cease and Desist of Defamation Acts, Satisfaction of Loan and Debt Release, Invoice of Final Payment in Accord and Satisfaction, Notice of Sale of Vehicle and Title Release, Immediate Closure of Account, Notice of Unlawful Practices, Notice of Estoppel ). \n\nXXXX XXXX, the representative from Bridgecrest who manages all responses to my CFPB complaints and my account operations singularly, has also directed Defamatory Acts against me and has refused to thoroughly address my concerns or complaints. I have been denied the opportunity to speak with any other representatives or superiors at Bridgecrest about my grievances or any transgressions carried out by this company. This infringes on my right to challenge inaccuracies and unjust procedures, and I am requesting to correspond with someone else at Bridgecrest who will consider my worries impartially. I would also like for XXXX XXXX XXXX to be involved in all future discussions. Moreover, I am requesting a thorough examination of all exchanges and inquiries that are alleged to have been conducted by this Bridgecrest representative. I feel I have been unfairly treated with regard to my concerns and that my rights have been breached. \n\n( Attachments include Invoice of Final payment, Validation Requests ( 3 ), Bank Statement, Bridgecrest Transaction Report ) which shows account was discharged ( Attachments with Red marking indicates important information including response letter of false statements made by XXXXXX/XX/XXXX ) Please note that this will also be reported to the FTC and Texas Attorney General which may include legal action I ask the CFPB to investigate all actions taken by XXXXXX/XX/XXXX and request a different agent and or supervisor of Bridgecrest to look into these actions taken against me.

The timeline of events is as follows : On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed fraudulent charges on my Citibank debit card and promptly reported the issue to Citibank. I also requested a new debit card and contacted the stores where the fraudulent charges occurred to report the issue. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I had a three-hour phone call with XXXX XXXX ( claiming to be a higher-level Citibank employee in the fraud department ) at XXXX. During this call, we went over each fraudulent charge. XXXX assured me that seven of the charges had been reported and were in the process of being investigated. She also assured me that my Citibank credit card was not affected. However, during this call, she accidentally forwarded my personal cell phone number to Citibank 's hotline for XXXX days, causing me to miss important voicemails. Furthermore, my Citibank online account was locked, and despite assistance in resetting the password, it did not work. I was informed that someone using a XXXX XXXX phone had been utilizing mobile pay with my debit card. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received an incoming call from Citibank at XXXX, which lasted only one minute. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I made two separate one-hour phone calls to XXXX.

In order to activate the replacement debit card, I inserted it into the ATM and created a new pin. However, immediately after the transaction, I was locked out of my account. At this point, my checking balance was {$14000.00}, and my credit card balance was {$18000.00}. I also received a missed call from CITI at XXXX during this time. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, during my third in-person visit to Citibank in XXXX XXXX XXXX CA, my ATM card did not work at the ATM.

The fraudulent charges and the credit card loan have severely impacted my credit score, my ability to make major purchases, and increased the cost of future credit. I have spent countless hours trying to resolve this issue, impacting both my personal and professional life.

In XXXX of XXXX I traveled XXXX miles north of XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX to spend time and the holidays with my youngest son who was also on track to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I found the pace of the XXXX XXXX XXXX and surrounding areas to be more conducive to my health issues and my age ( XXXX  ). I checked out of the last hotel I stayed in in XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX I was concerned over the strange behavior and interaction that I had with the front desk person that checked me into this hotel and when I was told that she had disappeared/quit abruptly with no notice I decided to call Bloomingdale 's customer service number and request them to close my Bloomingdale 's credit card because I feared that this missing front desk person who had shared with me that she was quitting her job at the hotel in a couple of days without giving them any notice because she was leaving the country permanently to start a new life and to take another job in XXXX ( I believe she said ) and she also shared the fact that was having a lot of financial difficulty. This lead me to be concerned that she might use my credit card to travel out of the country so I asked Bloomingdale 's customer service to cancel my card and to issue a new one. There were no fraudulent charges on this card ending XXXX that I requested them to close. Bloomingdale 's closed this card at my request ending XXXX and they also issued/ a new replacement card to my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX California which is where I receive my mail. I stayed in XXXX XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX approximately is the date I returned XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I received a text message and an email from Bloomingdale 's fraud department asking me if I had used the new replacement card ending XXXX to make purchases totaling {$290.00}. I texted back and responded \" No '' that I haven't received the new replacement card yet and \" no '' I haven't used it to make any purchases. I don't have the card. Next, I called in and spoke to Bloomingdale 's fraud department investigators. I told them that I am still in XXXX XXXX XXXX, California where I have been since XXXX of XXXX and that the replacement card should still be in my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, California because I haven't picked it up yet. Next I tried to sign into my account on line to see the charges that the fraud department was referring to and to file a dispute for any unauthorized charges. The account for the new replacement card ending XXXX was totally blocked on line so I couldn't view any charges and I wasn't able to file a dispute because the account was still showing not yet activated or inactivate and asking me to activate the new replacement card???? which I was surprised to see and I wondered how the new card was used to make purchases if it had not yet been activated. Next, I called my post office where my po box is located and I asked them how my new replacement card could have been used when it should still be in my po box . I had to speak to the Post Office Manager to have her look into how this could have happened. She informed me that my po box had been broken into and the card was stolen along with other pieces of mail because my box was empty she said. Next I called Bloomingdale 's fraud investigators back and I shared with them that my po box had been broken into and the card was stolen along with my other mail. The fraud person had me file a dispute over the phone with her for what she said was {$290.00} in fraudulent charges made using the replacement card ending XXXX. I gave my statement of the fact that I am still XXXX miles away up north in XXXX XXXX XXXX and that I have many many receipts for purchases that I have made every day up to XX/XX/XXXX to prove it if she needed it and that I could provide a statement from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding my po box having been broken into if she needed it. The fraud investigator responded \" np '' that she didn't need any of the items that I offered and that my dispute of the charges statement is all that she needed to conduct her investigation. The next day or so when I signed back into my Bloomingdale 's original credit card account ending XXXX I could see my current balance of {$570.00} ( new balance after I deducted my XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$200.00}. ) now had the additional fraudulent charges of {$290.00} added to my outstanding balance which brought my balance up to {$870.00}. On approximately XX/XX/XXXX I called Bloomingdale 's and asked them why they added the fraudulent charges to my current correct outstanding balance of {$570.00} and I also asked them when they would be removing this {$290.00} in fraudulent charges from my correct balance of {$570.00}. The representative said that they would remove the fraudulent charges of {$290.00} after they complete their investigation. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Bloomingdale 's credit department/customer service and XXXX asked them to assist me in paying off my balance in full so that only the fraudulent charges would be remaining on the account until they completed their investigation and remove the fraudulent charges of {$290.00} The Bloomingdale 's credit dept. representative said that my full outstanding balance was {$560.00}. I then told her that my outstanding balance according to my latest statement cutoff dated XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXs {$570.00}. The representative then stated that I was given a credit of! XXXX for interest that they had erroneously charged me so that brought my true outstanding balance in full to pay my account ending XXXX off to {$560.00}. I gave her my debit card information to complete the payoff transaction. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice from the Bloomingdale 's credit department stating that my account balance is now XXXX. When I went in on line to look at my account for card ending XXXX it was still showing the fraudulent charges of {$290.00} on the account after my payment had been deducted from the balance. I have all of the statement for this account from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX showing all of the payments and outstanding balances and it also shows the addition of the {$290.00} as purchases on my XX/XX/XXXX statement. The {$290.00} fraudulent balance was still showing on my account after they issued a second replacement card ending XXXX and changed my original account number from XXXX to XXXX. On line originally they flagged my accounts ending XXXX and XXXX as card lost/stolen and they left my new account acct. that's attached to the second new replacement card ending XXXX open/active with a balance that has ranged from {$290.00} down to {$230.00} and now it's at {$170.00} and why the balance amount keeps changing I really have no idea and it is not showing transactions to explain why in the account summary area on line as of today. They have shut off the ability to dispute any charges or transaction amounts for months now in the account in my account on line portal. I have a paper statement with the cutoff date of XX/XX/XXXX that shows there is a XXXX balance and a XXXX payment due on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX which is correct. The next statement shows an account balance due of {$230.00} with a payment due on XX/XX/XXXX. I called in and asked what this {$230.00} balance is for because they had never removed the {$290.00} fraudulent charges I assumed. I was told that it was a reversal of a {$200.00}. payment that was credited twice to the account on the XX/XX/XXXX closing date statement. I had to ask for the paper statements to be sent to me because access to the account summary for card account ending XXXX did not show any transactions. When I received the paper statements I saw many many transactions, credits and debits that I had no knowledge of, since I was still in XXXX XXXX XXXX, California and I still didn't have a Bloomingdale 's credit card since XXXX of XXXX when I requested my original card to be closed as I have previously explained so none of the activity on the XX/XX/XXXX statement was mine. When I did the calculations of all of the purchases and the credits and debits including the {$200.00}. payment error that they were referring to every thing balanced out to XXXX balance which is why there was no payment due on XX/XX/XXXX. At my request to speak to some one in their corporate office, in response, a person by the name of XXXX XXXX was assigned to my concerns with this outstanding balance issue on my account ending XXXX. XXXX XXXX contends via an email she sent me that this {$230.00}. balance is the XX/XX/XXXX payment I made for {$200.00}. that was credited to my account in XXXX correctly and then according to XXXX XXXX it was credited again to my account a second time in XX/XX/XXXX erroneously. I have explained to XXXX XXXX many times via email that my balance was paid off in full according to my statement balances and I have not received a {$200.00}. credit reversal and the XXXX statement that she is referring to has many charges including this {$200.00}. but when you do the calculations of the debits and the credits including this {$200.00}. erroneous payment it was also credited and then debited back out correctly on the paper statement that I received for XX/XX/XXXX and their ending balance was XXXX correctly and when I did the calculations I also came to a XXXX balance on my account and this also includes my payoff amount of {$560.00} that I made on XX/XX/XXXX which I have a confirmation of payment from your credit department and a confirmation letter dated XX/XX/XXXX that my account balance is XXXX. Therefore, XXXX XXXX is the source of any balances left on my account ending XXXX and from XX/XX/XXXX up until today, XX/XX/XXXX, I have not used any Bloomingdale 's credit card including the card ending XXXX which I picked up from my po box on XX/XX/XXXX after I received my newly keyed po box keys resulting from the break in that happened in XX/XX/XXXX. Now, currently some one has came up with a current outstanding balance of {$170.00} for acct. ending XXXX and a whole lot of computations have been made on this account since my XX/XX/XXXX statement which includes my pay off payment of {$560.00} but this current {$170.00} balance is not from any transactions that I have made. Also, on XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Bloomingdale 's fraud department that states that they found all of the transactions made on XX/XX/XXXX to be fraudulent and that they removed this amount from my account ending XXXX. The problem is that they moved the balance of the fraudulent charges to my second new replacement card acct. ending XXXX and this fraudulent balance remained there until they did their calculations on the statement for XX/XX/XXXX with an ending balance of XXXX. I do not know who added this new balance of {$230.00} back on my account ending XXXX on the XX/XX/XXXX statement payment due on XX/XX/XXXX but it has nothing to do with me and it is their error, Also I have requested my XX/XX/XXXX statement for the third time as of today and Bloomingdale 's has failed to provide this XX/XX/XXXX paper statement to me because I believe that thety are missing a large payment I made on my account in XX/XX/XXXX, Also, in XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX I realized that they were charging me interest on my \" promotional purchases with no interest until XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX '' unless I missed a payment which I had not so I called them on it and they researched it and they had to issue me a credit, and I believe they lost a payment I made in XX/XX/XXXX which is why I am asking for my paper statement for XX/XX/XXXX that they have not yet provided me with, I also made a courtesy extra payment of {$14.00} on XX/XX/XXXX just in case they come back later and say they should not have given me a credit of {$13.00} in XX/XX/XXXX for over charging me interest for the second time.

I immediately signed up for monthly automatic payments by entering my bank information using the Fortiva website. A monthly deduction of {$120.00} was made without any issue ( and is still being deducted as I wait for this issue to be resolved ). \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, several weeks before the end of the 12-month interest deferment I made the final payment of {$840.00} using the Fortiva website ( as usual ) in order to avoid interest. I received notice on the website that the web payment was received including a thank you message. On XX/XX/XXXX, nearly three weeks later, an additional monthly payment of {$120.00} was deducted. Unbeknownst to me, the final payment I had made on XX/XX/XXXX of {$840.00} had been reversed by Fortiva, As I am not enrolled in paperless billing, this was not communicated to me until I received my monthly statement in the mail in XXXX, past the date of the promotional expiration. I was shocked to see the payment reversal and the new additional interest charge of {$530.00}. Especially given the fact that my automatic payments always go through without a problem and I used the same payment method/source. \n\nI called Fortiva Customer Service on XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX. I explained my concern that my payment was reversed and interest had been applied and that I'd like to pay off the balance again and have the interest removed. I was told by the representative that they could not tell me why my payment had been reversed and that there was nothing they could do about it since I was past the promotional expiration. I explained that it was not communicated to me that the payment was reversed and the service agent stated that notice of the reversal was in the XX/XX/XXXX statement, again too late to make the payment on time. She later backtracked, stating that there would be no record of this transaction on Fortiva 's end because of \" invalid information '' with my banking information. When I asked to verify what account and banking information I had entered ( since I had used the same information saved in the automatic payments ) the customer service agent became defensive and hostile. She refused to provide any additional information or guidance to resolve the issue, including any actual proof that the transaction failed because of misinformation. She repeatedly insisted that the XX/XX/XXXX statement was the only notice, as the account \" cycled '' not resulting in the full interest charge. \n\nShe repeatedly insisted that the information in the bill payment portal was somehow incorrect causing the transaction to fail, even though this payment information has been working for the last 11 months. \n\nWhen I asked about communicating with my bank regarding the failed transaction, the customer service agent insisted that there was no record of the transaction, that it must be an incorrect account number and therefore there would be no transaction history or evidence from my bank. She said if I could have my bank confirm the payment on their end, they could perhaps forgive a percentage of the interest. I asked to speak to a manager and she told me that no matter who I spoke to, the answer would be the same. \n\nThe agent aggressively terminated the call at about XXXX by hanging up on me and stating, \" I've already explained everything, XXXX XXXX. Goodbye. '' I was confused and in tears. \n\nI called my bank and found proof of the payment, but my bank could see no reason for the payment being reversed. I called Fortiva and spoke to a new representative, with my bank on the line who confirmed the payment had been attempted on my end. The agent offered to forgive a portion of the interest, but not the entirety. I requested a call from the corporate office. \n\nI received a call on XX/XX/XXXX from the corporate office. They were understanding and agreed that I could pay off the new balance of {$770.00} ( the original balance of {$840.00} minus the automatic payment of XXXX made on XX/XX/XXXX ) and they would remove the interest and my account would be at XXXX. \n\nI made the payment later that week, again through the Fortiva website and received confirmation on the screen. However, the payment never reflected on my account. Since I used the Fortiva website, my bank was unable to confirm and Fortiva claims to have no record ( as they claimed in prior conversations in XXXX ). The customer service agent repeatedly lost signal could not answer my questions and ended the call prematurely. \n\nI am feeling defeated and disrespected after months of making timely payments, paying off the balance prior to the promotional expiration only to have my payments reversed or erased. I continue to have the monthly deduction but have been unable to pay off the balance despite my attempts, therefore I have since been charged additional interest totaling {$600.00}.\n\nIn researching the company, I have found many similar complaints.

I contacted Newrez immediately after the mortgage loan was transferred to inquire about their forms and instructions for submitting the same request. Newrez has stated several reasons for not providing the forms in both email correspondence and phone conversations : 1 ) I need to wait up to 60 days after the mortgage loan was transferred, 2 ) they have to establish a PMI account first, and 3 ) they can not provide forms or instructions in advance of the two-year seasoning of the mortgage loan. None of these are valid. My right to initiate termination of mortgage insurance is a XXXX XXXX servicing guideline and the mortgage servicer has no right to impose policies which impede my request. The information provided by Newrez is misleading and predatory.

It's worth noting that I no longer own or possess this vehicle.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 USC section 1681i, I have the right to dispute and request an investigation into any inaccuracies on my credit report, with the expectation that this account is deleted. This letter serves as my formal complaint and request for an investigation regarding the inaccuracies associated with my Westlake Portfolio Management account. \n\nThe relevant details regarding this matter are as follows : 1. Account Information : - Creditor : Westlake Portfolio Management - Account Number : XXXX - Date of Repossession : XX/XX/2023 - Current Status : The account is incorrectly reported as having a negative history and active payments. \n\n2. Background : In XX/XX/2023, Westlake Portfolio Management repossessed my vehicle due to financial hardship. Following the repossession, I have not made any further payments on the account, and the vehicle is no longer in my possession. \n\n3. Inaccuracy : Despite the repossession and cessation of payments, Westlake Portfolio Management continues to report the account as having a negative history and active payments. This inaccurate reporting is damaging my credit score and financial reputation, affecting my ability to secure loans, housing, and employment. \n\n4.Supporting Documents : -Enclosed with this letter, you will find the most recent copy of my credit report.\n\nI request that you promptly initiate an investigation into this matter and ensure that Westlake Portfolio Management rectifies this account on my credit report in accordance with the FCRA.

I tried to contact the store I purchased the mattress at for a several days by phone, emails, and a text line their outgoing message said to contact. I never received a response, I drove to the store on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  and received a number to call from a salesman to file the warranty claim. I waited the 10 day period with no response. After two weeks with no response, I left a XXXX review on XXXX Upon submitting that review, I received a reply to it, asking contact their escalation team, which I did ), and it was ignored as another Ashely employee began reaching out to us asking for the same information I had previously provided. We kept failing connect by phone as she was calling me when I was unavailable despite me informing her of this in an email. She never provided a phone number I could reach her at when I was available and the one on caller ID was their generic order line, was never able to reach her through it despite trying.

On XX/XX/XXXX, she tried to call me again when I'm not available and claims to have not received despite me using the same email chain we had been. At this point it had been 40 days since the incident and I still had no resolution, so I filed the first dispute with Synchrony Bank on the full charge of the transaction, as Ashley claimed to no longer have information the transaction for me to only file on just the affected items. On XX/XX/XXXX, while the the dispute was still under review and 23 days after filing the dispute and 66 days since the initial incident, Ashely attempted to contact us through my wife 's phone and left a voicemail ( we saved if needed ) after business hours. The message stated the warranty the claim needed to go through the mattress protector manufacturer, XXXX, and not Ashley, contrary to what we had been told at purchase. The Ashley employee also stated claim with XXXX had already been started by Ashley and approved, but I needed to contact XXXX to complete things. I contacted XXXX on XXXXXXXX  to check on this. The XXXX representative checked for claims under both mine and my wife 's phone numbers and found that Ashley had not filed anything as they had told us. He assisted me in starting a claim, making sure to note that I had not been getting responses from Ashely but had let them know immediately that I had a problem. I received a judgement within two hours from XXXX that my claim was denied due to not filing within 5 days of the incident. Upon receiving the response from XXXX, I updated the dispute information one my Ashley Furniture Homestores Synchrony Bank Credit Card with this information, outlining that it took Ashely 66 days from the incident to provide me information on this, and prior to the voicemail on the XXXX, it had been 26 days since they attempted to contact me. \n\nI received information that the dispute had been resolved in Ashley 's favor on XX/XX/XXXX, I was still liable for the remaining payments, and a further email would be sent when all documents were available for me to review. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Synchrony that all claim documents were available.

On XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  I received the decision that this dispute had also been found in Ashely 's favor. \n\nAshley Furniture Homestores gave me incorrect information as to who to contact in the event of an issue.

This resulted in myself, an XXXX man, being exploited for {$48.00}, XXXX on XX/XX/2023. \n\nCompounding the problem, Citis fraud investigation department focused its efforts on trying to absolve the bank of any responsibility. It sent a letter to me saying it wasnt the banks fault and then made it impossible to contact the bank again to discuss the issue further. This was done by forcing me through a XXXX  process to contact the bank for further explanation or to elevate the complaint. The system is clearly designed to be unreasonably difficult and time consuming to dissuade people from trying to pursue the matter further internally at the bank. \n\nCiti created a product targeted at gaining new accounts from the elderly and then failed to have reasonable and proper controls in place to prevent their being exploited on these accounts, creating a perfect storm allowing mass exploitation of the elderly. \nCitis systemic failures to try and prevent XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX are extensive and undoubtedly affects numerous customers. \n\nResolution : I ask that Citi refund the {$48.00}, XXXX to me and internally review and modify its processes to mitigate the risk of this happening to other elderly. If Citi chooses not to reimburse me, I request that the CFPB open an investigation into the banks practices related to mitigating XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. Lastly, a class action lawsuit is in order against Citi. \n\nDetailed facts highlighting Citis marketing to and then failing to protect the elderly, specifically myself an XXXX man. \n\nCiti marketed to and opened an account for me an elderly person. \n\nCiti created a Federally Insured very high interest rate savings account called Citi Accelerate Savings account with rates of 3 % to 5 % in an environment with competitive savings accounts offering less than 1 %.\n\nCiti marketed the Citi Accelerate Savings account account to the elderly including me. The advertising highlights language such as earn XXXX the national average on your savings and FDIC Insured.\n\nThe Citi Accelerate Savings account is obviously designed to attract the elderly who have savings, need the security of Federal insurance and who live on their savings and the interest it earns. \n\nShould the CFPB demand Citis marketing records including banner ads, video, paid search, paid social, email, print, direct mail, TV and Radio including broadcast, cable, and streaming, it will certainly show that the elderly were disproportionality targeted by Citis marketing of this product.\n\nShould the CFPB demand Citis account records for its Citi Accelerate Savings account it will certainly show that the elderly over index as consumers of this product relative to the general population, as it was designed to appeal to the elderly and then marketed to the elderly. \n\nCiti opened a new account for me, an XXXX  person without ordinary and customary protections being put in place. I was exploited by a stranger for {$48000.00} within months of opening the account. The money was wired to a XXXX  bank account, in an amount and destination that is obviously suspicious. \n\nCiti set up new accounts for the elderly and failed as a matter of policy to institute two-factor authentication, reviews of large wires, reviews of suspicious dollar amount wires, wires to XXXX accounts or other customary and ordinary protections that are nearly XXXX  on all bank accounts regardless of the owners age but that are particularly important for the elderly to mitigate the risk of them being defrauded. Citis failure to have proper policies in place to protect the XXXX  created an unreasonable security exploit that could be used against the elderly to defraud them. \n\nCitis failure to have policies in place to mandate the accounts of the XXXX  be set up with customary and ordinary protections against fraud and abuse led directly to me being exploited for {$48000.00}. \n\nIt is a given that a large transfer out of an elderly persons account to a XXXX  bank account when the person does not have a history of such transfers is suspicious. Citi has no policy in place or failed to use it to review suspicious transfers creating an unreasonable security exploit that could be used against the elderly to defraud them. \n\nA transfer to a XXXX  bank account slightly below {$50000.00}, especially when funds were in the account in excess of {$50000.00}, is patently suspicious as XXXX  know the bank must expeditiously report fraud above {$50000.00} to the FBI for its assistance in recovering the funds and for which the FBI has a high success rate. Citi has no policy in place or failed to use it to review a patently suspicious transfer creating an unreasonable security exploit that was used against me and elderly person to defraud me. \n\nIts an obvious failure of Citi not to have policies in place, or not to follow its policies, to flag for review patently suspicious transfers to foreign bank accounts that are outside of the normal activity of an elderly persons account. This led directly to me being exploited for {$48000.00}. \n\nWhen I became aware of the fraud, within XXXX hours of it occurring, I notified Citi. \n\nCiti failed to take timely and appropriate actions to mitigate my damages such as reversing the wire in a timely fashion, or to properly assist me in efforts to lawfully recover my stolen funds after the fraud occurred. \n\nInstead, Citi instituted an internal investigation which was specifically designed to cast blame on me an elderly customer while simultaneously covering up the banks failure to have reasonable and ordinary controls in place to prevent or at least mitigate elderly customers being defrauded. \n\nCiti declared itself blameless in a letter. The letter specified that if I wanted more information, I should call a specific phone number. \n\nWhen I call the number, it goes to a general call center which refuses to connect the customer to the fraud investigation department. I was forced to explain the situation to every new person and was transferred to XXXX or XXXX different departments, each of which said it couldnt help me.

The Fraud Investigations Department would call me back in XXXX to XXXX hours instead. This of course never happened. \n\nCiti has in place a XXXX  system that makes it nearly impossible for a customer to dispute or elevate internally at Citi its internal investigation. This is clearly a systematic effort specifically designed to dissuade customers from being able to elevate their case internally at Citi. This is not an ordinary big bank run around, it is a feature purpose built by the bank which specifically is an extra burden on all customer but in particular the elderly and it is carefully crafted to try and make customers give up and not pursue even valid claims any further. \n\nUnfortunately, this leaves me with few options other than requesting through the CFPB that Citi reimburse me or if that fails file a class action lawsuit against Citi for its systematic failures to prevent XXXX  XXXX XXXX.", "answer": "#### Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service"}, {"question": "In XX/XX/XXXX or around that date or week, i had {$500.00} stolen from my bank account in {$19.00} increments, the moment i woke up around XXXX or XXXX XXXX  it happened and i immediately called my bank and they helped me, i got a new card and a temporary card to use. the person who took my was named XXXX XXXX and the description of the transaction said MOBILE PURCHASE XXXX FL, I am in California, i woke up to a message saying i need to change my address on ups, i believed it because i had bought something online that same week. but they got my info some how. so i called, and they told me they'd handle it, i got my money back and got a temporary card and changed cards to a new one, then on XX/XX/XXXX, I got a temporary credit reversal and the bank took back all {$500.00} back away from me, how is that fair? the proof is in front of them. im in California not Florida and why would i send away {$500.00} in {$20.00} increments.

Both warehouse lenders, unaware of each other, would send funding for the loan to the title companies specified by the mortgage originator. The mortgage originator then disburses the money from XXXX lender to the borrower, while directing the title company to wire the money received from the other lender to mortgage originators bank account. The mortgage originators then provide fabricated mortgage documents to the warehouse lenders that falsely represented that the lenders funds had, in fact, been used to finance borrower loans. \nAssignment Fraud involves modifications to the original loan where the name of the bank who actually owns the note is changed on execution of the XXXX XXXX Agreement. The problem with these modifications ( actually new loans with new lenders ) is that the old loans remain unaffected. The existing cloud on title to the property, the mortgage deed ( or deed of trust ), the note, the obligation, the purported assignments etc. is being compounded by attempts to allow impostors to foreclose on the mortgage, collect on the note, modify the loan, or approve a short sale. The time XXXX is title where securitized loans were recorded, foreclosed, modified or sold. \nThe parties ( other than the borrower and possibly the Trustee on the Deed of Trust ) had actual knowledge that the lender was not the Lender, the terms of the obligation were already changed at the time of closing, the appraisal was false, the underwriting was negligent or fraudulent, the Good Faith Estimate was by definition rendered neither in good faith nor even close to an accurate estimate, and the list goes on and on. \nIn determining whether a particular loan is part of a double-funding or double-selling scheme, examiners and forensic XXXX should look for as evidence that a mortgage originator is engaging in this scheme and participating in a pattern of deception, forgery and fraud.

So, my total for this purchase was {$200.00}. \nI was going to utilize my XXXX ( Buy Now Pay Later ) company called Sezzle to make this purchase through their app which is installed on my phone.

As I was going to bring my phone to the credit card reader to electronically scan, it said I have a XXXX gift card in the amount of {$200.00}. I was like what, this isn't right... so the manager saw me getting frazzled and she said to come to the regular register, and she would help me. So, we went to the register and when I tried to scan, it then said on the XXXX register that I can not pay for a gift card with a gift card .... I did not understand or know what was going on at the moment. The female manager said I could not get a refund either because they don't refund gift cards. I said I don't want t a XXXX gift card and I said I want to buy the XXXX XXXX Gift Card she was now holding in her hand and waiting for my transaction to be paid for. I told her to void the transaction in progress ( which was for the purchase of the XXXX XXXX Gift Card ) and I immediately called Sezzle to tell them there was a mistake with the processing of the order.

I told the rep I was not trying to purchase a XXXX gift card, but I wanted a XXXX XXXX Gift Card. They said they couldn't help me but told me that gift cards never expire. Sezzle told me to take it up with XXXX because it was purchased in their store. I was not pleased with hearing that. I did not need a XXXX gift card let alone in such an odd amount. I never shop at XXXX, maybe 2 times a year ... and this was putting me into an awkward position at this point. No one noticed to say that stores such as XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and any other retail store NEVER CHARGES you for an activation fee on their own store gift cards, so this should have been a red flag that something in their system was not right.

I said to the rep, I DO NOT WANT A XXXX CARD AND I WAS TRYING TO PURCHASE A XXXX XXXX Gift Card.

The order # XXXX was assigned to the furniture I wanted, and the payment was successfully processed using my Synchrony PayPal MasterCard for the amount of {$2300.00} that day it was charged. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX I contacted the seller via chat to inquire about shipping time and dates on their website XXXX XXXX XXXX and did a virtual chat with a representative stating that it would take 3 to 5 business days for tracking information. Note : I did screen shot that conversation to fax as requested to the dispute team for PayPal MasterCard. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated an open claim to do a chargeback with Synchrony PayPal MasterCard for the amount reasons for not receiving merchandise at that time I did not want to pay interest or pay for product not received yet. In response, PayPal promptly placed the balance on hold, relieving me of any obligation to make payments or incur fees for interest during this process. And to note I found out later in XXXX I was not aware that they put it in as a dispute instead of chargeback. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX I have not received the tracking information from seller XXXX XXXX XXXX for the furniture I wanted and by this time PayPal MC has charged my credit card again for the amount which was a disappointment to me considering I have not received the furniture yet. So, I contacted Synchrony PayPal MasterCard to put in another chargeback until I received my furniture, and this turned into a dispute that PayPal MC representative put in for me And I was fine with that considering I had not received any tracking information or any email updates from this seller. \n\nI think at the beginning of XXXX, I contacted synchrony PayPal MasterCard again just to get updates on when I will get a refund for this because I have not received any information or updates from the seller. At this time PayPal MC wanted me to give the seller 40 days to send my furniture. The dispute team representative for synchrony PayPal said they got this off the website which I thought was strange that PayPal did not even contact the seller about tracking info with numbers or when I can receive product. To my dismay PayPal MC reinstated the funds to the merchant, which left me disappointed. However, I decided to exercise patience and wait for the full 40-days from the time of purchase timeframe as requested. \n\nBy this time, I had to keep putting in disputes so I would not be charged an interest fee and a monthly payment until I receive merchandise. \nAgain, I received my bill from synchrony PayPal MC asking me to pay a portion of the amount charged for the furniture that I have not received yet. I find this very disheartening to pay for something I have not received yet and have to pay a bill for. I did call PayPal MC to inform them that I will be putting in a dispute for the seller XXXX XXXX XXXX after the 40 days that PayPal MC requested me to wait for not providing tracking information and not delivering on their promise to send me merchandise that I am being charged for if they have not sent me tracking after the 40 days. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I initiated a chat conversation with XXXX XXXX XXXX to address the prolonged delay in my order. During the chat, I communicated to the representative that the order had surpassed the 40-day policy and requested a full refund due to seller not holding up there in after the 40 days, along with a full refund. To my surprise, the merchant informed me via chat that they had already canceled the order, and that they did not receive funds for PayPal MC Instead, they indicated that the funds were held by PayPal Mastercard, suggesting that I should contact PayPal directly to facilitate the process of obtaining a complete refund. Note : I did screen shot that conversation to fax as requested to the dispute team for PayPal MasterCard. \n\nOn the same day XX/XX/XXXX I contacted PayPal MasterCard to inform them that the merchant stated that they did not have my money refund and funds were held by PayPal and that they were not going to send product because of the initial dispute that was put in on XX/XX/XXXX I informed them that I did not put in a dispute I only put in a charge back that was PayPal MasterCards dispute team addressing the situation and not correctly categorizing my discernment with pain with a chargeback instead they put it as a dispute instead and that was not my fault I was not intending on canceling my purchase at that time I was intending to let PayPal know that they shouldnt charge me for merchant that I have not received yet. \n\nIn XXXX, By this time I had to keep putting in for disputes with PayPal dispute team to correct the situation and give me back my funds that they are holding from me. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I contact the seller XXXX XXXX XXXX support via chat that for the past three months, I have been engaged in ongoing correspondence with both XXXX XXXX XXXX 's support team via chat and PayPal MasterCard and during a conversation with XXXX XXXX XXXX support, it was revealed that the furniture was not shipped due to a dispute I raised with PayPal. I must clarify that I initiated the dispute after waiting for more than 40 days for the furniture to arrive, which I believe is an excessively long duration for such a purchase. I informed PayPal MasterCard of this because PayPal MC said seller shipped Merchandise to me but yet I dont have tracking or nor did I sign for anything of the sort and that I owe {$2300.00} And I inform PayPal that I did not receive nor signed my signature for that furniture. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, After I contacted the seller again XXXX XXXX XXXX by email and stated the same thing I reached out to PayPal MasterCard to let them know that the seller XXXX XXXX XXXX claimed they didn't have the money funds either from PayPal MC. The seller XXXX XXXX XXXX also said they wouldn't send the product due to an issue that started on XX/XX/XXXX with a dispute. I clarified to XXXX XXXX XXXX the seller that I didn't file a dispute but rather a chargeback during that time because PayPal had already billed me for this merchandise, and I did not have the merchandise in my possession. PayPal MasterCard 's dispute team mislabeled it as a dispute, which was not my intention because I put in for a chargeback during that time in XXXX. I just wanted to inform PayPal MC that they shouldnt charge me for a product I hadn't received yet and to put it as a chargeback. Now Im believing that this led to a chain reaction leading to no merchandise sent and PayPal still holding funds on both ends. \n\nIn XXXX, I found myself in a situation where I had to initiate another dispute with PayPal MasterCard. This became necessary because I wasn't receiving any assistance from them, and my credit card still carried a balance of {$2300.00} with an impending payment due. Consequently, I had to file a dispute to avoid making that payment. Additionally, I wanted to communicate that the merchandise I had ordered had not been sent, and I was seeking a full refund. \n\nWhen I contacted PayPal, they informed me that the seller claimed to have sent the merchandise to me, which was not true. To date, I have not received anything, yet I am being billed for a product I do not possess. I requested PayPal MasterCard to provide me with tracking information, but they have yet to do so. They mentioned that they released funds in favor of the seller based on the assertion that I received the merchandise, which is untrue. \n\nToday is XX/XX/XXXX, and I'm still facing the same issue that started earlier this year. I have an update from the seller, XXXX XXXX XXXX. I reached out to them via email today to discuss resolving the situation since Synchrony PayPal MasterCard hasn't taken any action. In the email I left my name and number to contact me again about resolving this situation and in the process of writing this letter to CFPB, I received the sellers call. I did record audio of the conversation as evidence for PayPal MasterCard, showing that the seller didn't send the merchandise. \n\nThe seller XXXX XXXX, owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX, informed me that PayPal hasn't released funds to him either. He apologized for the trouble I've been through, and From what I gathered on the conversation that we had he has other funds from buyers being held by PayPal because of this situation, Im guessing he wanted to reach out now considering this is causing him to not receive funds for the other sales being held due to this situation but I do wished and expressed to him that we could have resolved this sooner with only him having funds held up for just me not others that use PayPal as a form of credit. He mentioned that he wanted to resolve this through PayPal as well but they are giving him the run a round as well as myself And he mentioned that he wanted a restocking fee which I informed him that I did not cancel my order I just never received shipping information in PayPal and their neglect didnt relay information to him or myself about both parties I myself did reach out several times about shipping to them and I informed him I have not received any information on his side until now because of money held up for other purchases he wants to retrieve. I mentioned that the problem might have originated from PayPal categorizing it as a dispute instead of a chargeback, which set off a chain reaction that PayPal didn't rectify on either end.\n\nThe seller has confirmed that he doesn't possess the funds he initially claimed, and I have yet to receive my full refund of {$2300.00} from PayPal MC. In my view, a fair resolution would involve me receiving my complete refund from PayPal MasterCard. Additionally, I believe PayPal MC should not charge credit card unless seller have tracking info with dates and maybe PayPal covers any fee for seller, as my intention was to acquire the merchandise. Unfortunately, circumstances have led me to purchase alternative furniture, rendering the items he has on hand unnecessary. \n\nI apologize for the length of this letter, and I tried to put the dates in as close as possible to when I remembered them and some of the record keeping I have saved to convey the ongoing nature of this issue. Managing everything has been quite challenging, especially given that it's been nearly six months of dealing with this situation. but I wanted to provide as much detail as possible. I hope that this information can assist in resolving the issue between myself and the seller, as well as our ongoing situation with the credit card company Synchrony PayPal MasterCard. I look forward to hearing from you soon and am hopeful that you can provide assistance in this matter. \nPS I tried to attach all the documents I could find to help me and I could not upload the audio due to audio file to large. \n\nThank you, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX", "answer": "#### Credit card"}, {"question": "REQUESTED WIRE TRANSFER OF {$60000.00} TO XXXX XXXX  TO START A E-COMMERCE BUSINESS, TRANSFERRED THE MONEY VIA WIRE TRANSFER FROM MY ACCOUNT AT WELLS FARGO TO XXXX XXXX ACCOUNT ALSO AT WELLS FARGO.

These violations include : Using a name other than their true name when attempting to collect a debt : As noted above, on one credit report ( XXXX ) the invalid debt is reported as belonging to \" Elite Collection Service '' ; however, this name was not an approved Assumed Business Name in the State of Oregon where I reside ( see attached documentation showing lapse of XXXX registration in XXXX of XXXX ). They have continued to report this invalid debt under that name for at least the last year to XXXX, likely violating both FDCPA \" true name '' regulations as well as Oregon statute ORS 648. The company has reported the invalid debt using their true name with another bureau ( XXXX ), apparently to deliberately create confusion as to who the alleged holder of the invalid debt is. As outlined in the following paragraphs, I believe they have done so to attempt to collect on the same invalid debt twice as two different companies and/or to obfuscate the fact that they have no legal right to attempt to collect said invalid debt. \n\nProviding false information to a credit reporting bureau : On or about XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to electronically dispute this invalid debt with both XXXX and XXXX, who later claimed to have \" verified '' the debt ; I have subsequently submitted a second dispute via certified mail to these bureaus that is still in process. In addition to providing the false information that an invalid debt was \" verified '', I also noted that the furnisher provided information allowing XXXX to update the address for \" Elite Collection Services '' from the initial XXXX XXXX XXXX on the report I obtained in XX/XX/XXXX to a street address ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, WA XXXX ) and to added a phone number. The phone number matches the XXXX given on the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX report for Elite Recovery Group, LLC ; however, the provided address does match the address for Elite Collection Services , LLC. which XXXX claims to be defunct since XXXX ( in fact, defunct since XXXX ; see below ). I have confirmed as of XX/XX/XXXX that this address is now occupied by a different business known as XXXX XXXX XXXX ( see attachments ) and has been so for several months. Therefore, it appears that the data furnisher that provided information to XXXX ( presumably Elite Recovery Group, LLC itself, based on the updated phone number ) appears to have provided deliberately misleading and false information regarding the holder of the debt, possibly to continue the ruse that Elite Collection Services , LLC is still ( or ever was ) a legitimate and operational debt collector. \n\nPursuing a debt they knew to be invalid : On XX/XX/XXXX, my ex-partner provided video evidence to an entity claiming to be \" Elite Collection Services '' regarding the invalid nature of the alleged debt ( see attached statement ). When making payments the next day she reported to me her total balance of all accounts with the company had dropped from approximately {$2300.00} to {$0.00} ( see attached screenshots ) after paying them {$310.00} ; this final balance was so small their system refused to allow her to pay. She told me she believed the balance had been adjusted based on their review of the evidence and that the debt was thereby effectively settled as a result of their recognition of the debt being invalid. \n\nHowever, Elite Recovery Group, LLC/ '' Elite Collection Services XXXX appears to have either erred in failing to report the ( still invalid ) debt as paid or ignored their duty to reinvestigate a disputed debt under the FDCPA and simply reported the invalid debt as in collections. I would also note the supposed amount of the invalid debt on the invoice provided to XXXX XXXX by \" Elite Collection Services '' of {$1700.00} does not match the alleged initial amount on either credit report of {$1600.00} ; I question, given this discrepancy, how \" Elite Collection Services '' could have \" verified '' or \" validated '' this invalid debt. \n\nPursuing a debt they have no legal right to pursue : As this invalid debt was originally reported to credit bureaus in XXXX of XXXX and Elite Collection Services , LLC was not incorporated as an LLC until XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX in the State of Washington ( see attached documentation ), they can not be the first collection agency to have reported the invalid debt. While the website for Elite Recovery Group, LLC claims they were \" converted '' from \" Elite Collection Services '' in XXXX, this is an untrue statement and one I believe that is deliberately misleading, intended to give the impression that debts obtained under a previous entity Elite Collections Group, LLC were legally transferred to Elite Recovery Group, LLC by this alleged \" conversion '' ; however, no state records indicate that Elite Recovery Group was \" converted '' from or legally connected to any previous entity in any way. In fact, Elite Collection Services , LLC, was not a valid business entity in its purported home state of Washington as of XXXX of XXXX due to voluntary dissolution by the owner, after which the company was never reinstated ( see attached documentation ). Instead, the sole member of the now-dissolved Elite Collection Services , LLC ( also, the apparent primary member/owner of Elite Recovery Group, LLC ) appears to have continued with normal business operations while dissolved, in violation of Washington law. To mask the fact he was operating illegally he appears to have intentionally failed to inform the State of Oregon that the XXXX XXXX was dissolved ; rather than properly incorporating as a domestic LLC in Oregon at any point, the owner used the said dissolved LLC 's now-invalid but still-extant foreign LLC registration in Oregon to fraudulently establish purportedly Oregon-based foreign LLC authorities in Washington and Nevada , and to falsely claim to be Oregon-based to the XXXX system ( see documentation ; note in particular that the claimed formation date for the alleged Oregon-based version of Elite Collection Services , LLC XXXX XXXX is XX/XX/XXXX XXXX which is in fact the date that the original Washington-based Elite Collection Services , LLC was granted authorization as a foreign LLC in Oregon ). He then used this fraudulent XXXX XXXX XXXX registration to operate in Washington, all the while continuing to claim the now-dissolved Washington-based LLC was still valid to the State of Oregon, until forming Elite Recovery Group, LLC in XXXX and withdrawing the fraudulent foreign LLC registrations. To summarize : the Washington-based Elite Collection Services , LLC has been dissolved since XXXX and no Oregon-based LLC by the name of Elite Collection Services , LLC has ever existed , despite the information provided by the owner of the alleged business to the XXXX and the states of Washington and Nevada. Thus, it would not have been possible for Elite Collection Services , LLC, which had no valid legal existence in any state after XXXX of XXXX, to legally or rightfully obtain ownership of or rights to the invalid debt in XXXX, to report the debt to credit bureaus, or to transfer said rights to a legally distinct third party such as Elite Recovery Group, LLC, at any point thereafter. Any and all attempts to collect upon said invalid debt or transfer that debt to a third party by \" Elite Collection Services, '' Elite Collection Services , LLC, Elite Recovery Group, LLC and any of their employees or officers have been, are and will continue to be invalid and illegal.", "answer": "#### Debt collection"}, {"question": "On XXXX XXXX @ approx XXXX I stopped at a drive up atm ( XXXX ) that was provided by USAA XXXX I did everything requested to withdraw {$300.00} the money slot never opened and the screen stated you did not take money in allotted time, but then printed a receipt like I received my funds.

As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, I see that there is a collection item on my XXXX credit report for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with a balance of {$310.00}. For several years leading up to XX/XX/XXXX, I had been using XXXX XXXX XXXX  for both mobile and internet services and I switched both to XXXX for internet on XX/XX/XXXX and mobile on XX/XX/XXXX. I had an XXXX XXXX XXXX modem that I returned using the instructions I found on XXXX XXXX XXXX website which required returning to a XXXX store. I have a receipt from the XXXX store for the return of the XXXX XXXX XXXX equipment dated XX/XX/XXXX. The XXXX receipt has a return reference number and the device serial and model number included on document this receipt is attached to this issue. I tried on many occasions to cancel both mobile and internet services with XXXX XXXX XXXX by phone, but was told that I needed a PIN that they gave me when I started using the service multiple years earlier. I did not have the PIN and they told me I could not cancel service without it. They suggested I go to a specific XXXX XXXX XXXX  store to authenticate myself to them so I could get the PIN. I visited the exact store they specified and the store manager told me that they don't do anything like that there. The store manager gave me a phone number to call and I called and it was the same routine where in order to cancel services I needed a PIN that I did not have. I asked the XXXX XXXX XXXX operator if they had an email address, website or mailing address where I could send documents that proved I stopped using their internet services on XX/XX/XXXX, and stopped using the mobile service on XX/XX/XXXX and returned the modem on XX/XX/XXXX. They said they did not have any email address, or web address or mailing address that would accept any such documents. It appears to me that XXXX XXXX XXXX is making it difficult if not impossible, for a customer to cancel a service and they further continue billing and turn these improperly billed amounts over to collection agencies. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Prince Parker & Associates, a debt collector, stating I owed {$310.00} to XXXX XXXX and I responded on XX/XX/XXXX with a letter containing this explanation as well as documents proving that I returned the modem and had attempted on several occasions to notify XXXX XXXX XXXX  that I was no longer using the service. Then on XX/XX/XXXX I received another letter from a different entity, XXXX XXXX XXXX saying I owe XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$310.00}. I responded with another letter dated XX/XX/XXXX which enclosed the letter I had provided to Prince Parker on XX/XX/XXXX. Note that at the time I stopped using the XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX service in XX/XX/XXXX, I had a combined mobile and internet package with XXXX XXXX XXXX where I paid a mobile bill each month and the internet service was free as long as I had the combined mobile and internet accounts. I stopped using internet on XX/XX/XXXX and mobile on XX/XX/XXXX. I also was unable to cancel my XXXX XXXX XXXX mobile service and XXXX XXXX XXXX continued to send me bills for complete months of mobile service long after my mobile phone number and service had been moved to XXXX. The bills from XXXX XXXX XXXX for mobile service for the time subsequent to my transfer to XXXX went to a different credit collection agency named XXXX XXXX XXXX. I sent XXXX  a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX and also paid them {$17.00} for a few days of mobile service that I did owe AT & T ( an amount I calculated myself because I could never get anyone at XXXX XXXX XXXX to send me a final bill just for the last few days that I used the service ).

( See attached second to last attachment. ) I was not an unauthorized party. I, XXXX XXXX, am filing a complaint against citi bank for handling my fraud complaint abusively between the periods of early XXXX and present. I, XXXX XXXX am uploading documents newly requested of me by Citi Bank earlier today and I am writing that the CFPB complaint COMPLAINT ID XXXX SUBMITTED ON XX/XX/XXXX was not submitted by an unauthorized party as was alleged to me through CFPB by Citi Bank XXXX That complaint had been submitted by myself, XXXX XXXX, and the bank never had reason to believe that it was not other than their greed and their pride from my complaining about their employees they are trying to confuse the situation about and cover up for. As stated in that complaint, the dispute of this transaction did not begin over telephone, it began the morning after the initial mugging I believe was on or around XX/XX/XXXX I reported in person at a citi bank that my card and my IDs and phones had been stolen. Because everything had been stolen, the bank threatened to call police on me and accused me of being an illegal immigrant who was underdressed. I was not underdressed and I was a XXXX citizen. The bank should have stopped the card on that day when I reported. I could recognize the employee who threatened to call police on me for having no ID if I saw him. He should not be employed. As result of his threat I was forced to return to the violent lease for my ID back. I was coerced to pretend to be the assailant 's wife and coerced to not mention anymore to citibank that I was a victim of violent crime. They did also lie that they did not say that the reason they denied the dispute was because the transaction was too large, because they did say that they would deny the transaction if it was too large unless I submitted the required forms, and because I submitted the required forms with proof of mail and citi bank repeatedly refused to respond to them or else explain why they were denied. \n\nThey say that only certain documents are required by mail. I said have proof of mail that I submitted the documents. They used false phone conversations and abused me during phone conversations. They were XXXX trafficking me to my XXXX traffickers and threatening me with police when I reported in person or on the phone if in person. They are pretending that my in person report at the CitiBank in early XXXX of XXXX XXXX the morning after I was mugged of my card and keys does not exist. They refused to refund the transaction solely because the amount was too large in phone conversations as well for this transaction I am referring to on the bank statements that were requested. I was told the complaint was denied because I did not submit the correct form but then I submitted the correct form by mail and the bank is still pretending that when I sign the form my signature is obsolete. I have never given them sufficient reason to believe that I am not XXXX and citi bank does not have the mens rea to believe that I am not XXXX in their continued abusiveness towards me as a XXXX citizen or as a professional ( I happen to be licensed in fraud investigations ). They continue to treat me abusively and racistly as a lower class consumer to them only. \n\n\n\nThe citi bank employees who coerced me into a dangerous situation by my assailants, including but not limited to white collar criminals, discredit my fraud report as a consumer and feel unduly powerful with obsolete and coerced statements against victims of XXXX trafficking whose speech is being purposefully and abusively contextualized to suit the banks agenda generally. For example, Citi bank is trying to humiliate me for the fact of my XXXX trafficking victimization throughout the entire fall of XXXX after I was already mugged of my IDs, XXXX, and attempted murder of. I have since collected back identification and they still pretend not to have received it. They XXXX be planning something diabolical against my person through their policing fraud threats about my true identity, which is the identity they know to be XXXX XXXX legally and this identity, my identity, is also federally licensed by a United States FBI agent through a training program with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. It is no coincidence that I was mugged by a released prisoner and stolen from in fall XXXX and Citi Bank 's negligence to stop my card or assist my fraud investigation resulted in the released prisoner becoming radicalized and ordering her associate to break my neck on XX/XX/XXXX. The transactions were unauthorized and were made by organized crime and conspiracy that CitiBank pretends to believe I have no education or knowledge for. \n\nThe law firm mentioned on the transaction I'm disputing correctly as non-consensual or unauthorized even admits that they have no record of me or of the transaction when called. I also received confidential information from an intimidated victim witness other than myself pertaining to the alleged lawyer or that alleged identity XXXX on the bank statement. Again, I have never met this lawyer and I had not mentioned my situation of the fraudulent transaction to her but after it happened I found her and she started talking about how the alleged identity had aliases and how he had attempted murder of her with his car, but because of his white collar status he got the charged dropped and hired fake law enforcement to institutionalize and poison her with prescription and diagnostic fraud. Hence, whether she was telling the truth or not, the transaction is extremely suspicious as with the repetitive victimizations and stolen card that had occurred before. Because I mentioned violent crime and conspiracy after it first happened to the citi bank XXXX XXXX XXXX in person, and because citi bank 's first response to this report was that I was illegal immigrant ( my ID had been stolen along with the card ) and threatened me with police, I was coerced to pretend that I was the subletter 's wife who had mugged me to try to get any of my property back. I did not get it back and I was XXXX while I was trying to legally sleep in my own bed. As I was XXXX objectively forcibly at that time, the mugger and assailant I did not know was a serial XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) was holding me down forcibly as I was saying please no please let me go and threatening to break my neck in her hand while she XXXX XXXX me ( according to my language ) with her other hand. The XXXX was painful to say the least, but also extremely violent and threatening. My card was used to pay a lawyer that same month but it XXXX have been XXXX XXXX who did that because XXXX was the person who introduced me to XXXX and who planned my XXXX. I know that XXXX XXXX is associated with XXXX only through social media. I do not know when or who swiped the card at what time, only that it was stolen from me and that I was attacked repetitively physically during fall XXXX. \n\nCiti bank could have stepped in when I first asked in person in XXXX of XXXX, but they with the American public generally pretend that my in person encounters with them have never existed, as well as that they retaliate me for my initial complaints and coerced recorded statements abusively since complaints of violent crime are always automatically discredited by them psychologically. \n\nThey are not well. They pretend that my in person encounter with citi bank from when my card was first stolen did not exist, and they threatened me with policing and health fraud from trying to explain that my relationships to my XXXX traffickers were not consensual. I was a victim of repetitive victimization in fall XXXX that escalated into a violent attack against me by XXXX of the card thief 's associates on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. I know that the assaulter was XXXX of the card thief 's associates because she referred to him, because I saw her on his social media, and because he had promised me that he would send her to XXXX me if I left him. I am referring to XXXX XXXX who is the false male alias used by XXXX XXXX in fall XXXX to defraud me into a sublease before stealing my property and before they were arrested for the murder of XXXX XXXX in XXXX, who I also knew. \n\nI have never met any lawyer or authorized representative of the alleged law firm that charged my card XXXX dollars. I do not know who authorized a transaction. I did not authorize the transaction and I can pass a lie detecter test also as a fraud XXXX as to this. The alleged law firm even stated to me explicitly that they had no record of the transaction. I had also received an anonymous tip online implying a massive fraud ring surrounding the transaction that I accuse of being fraudulent. \n\nMy card was stolen and my identity was stolen repetitively by organized XXXX traffickers to include my biological mother, my ex husband XXXX XXXX, my mothers husband, my husbands friends, and multiple other paid assassins such as XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX Doll who broke my neck on XX/XX/XXXX, leaving me permanently XXXX since the re-break on XX/XX/XXXX. I am licensed in health care and criminal investigations and I am not lying or not possibly a target. I am actually a significant target of repetitive victimizations and high profile, white collar law enforcement professionals to include XXXX XXXX, who most directly assisted XXXX XXXX in stealing my valuables in fall XXXX. XXXX XXXX also had claimed to be a lawyer and appeared to have close ties with XXXX to retaliate me with in union square in fall XXXX. \n\nThere was a moment where I thought I was free after the first attack by XXXX. I walked into the citi bank XXXX XXXX XXXX in New York XXXX. I remember the incompetent employee who threatened me well facially bit I do not remember his name. He appeared to a XXXX male. I explained respectfully to him that I had been mugged of all my cards, keys, and IDs. He only threatened to call police on me for appearing underdressed and refused to serve me. I was not underdressed. \n\nThe phone calls that citi bank allege that I had with them are obsolete, and in the last letter they wrote to me they are pretending not to have read my cfpb complaint. They are also lying about what was said in the calls and in mail correspondence pertaining to the complaint, for which I was promised a refund and not an appeal of a denial but an actual refund pursuant to documents. They continuously pretend that I have never reported in person, but they also pretend that I have refused to submit the documents they asked. They continuously pretend that I have not submitted required documents even when I have, and they continuously attempt to criminalize, XXXX humiliate me, and threaten me with policing fraud and medical poisons ( diagnostic with prescription fraud ) from reporting violent crime in a so-called developed country. I have history of anaphylaxis and history of sudden unconsciousness ( beatings ) with near brain death.

I called the XXXX number to speak to an agent and after they looked into it. The only answer that was given to me at the time was that it looked like the check was not a real check. So, I said to myself, how is this so if it came from the state. They made it seem like from their end that someone had deposited a check into the account, but it wasn't cleared but the funds were given to me anyway. I got another check from state XXXX in the amount of XXXX and funds were given to me because the check cleared again on the next day. I just received another state XXXX check and I was able to deposit it and again the funds were given to me because the check cleared. I looked at my account online the next day just to see and sure enough they had a block on my account. I go in to speak with a teller and she called whomever she needed to see what and why was my account blocked. The person who she spoke with on the phone from the Citibank team. Had her to ask me what I needed the money for and what bills did I pay from this money given to me. The teller tells me after speaking to whomever, that the check didn't look real, and it was fraudulent activity going on come to find out later on the next day. My name had been put on the fraudulent list which I had no clue about until I spoke to the manager at this branch. I am startled, disappointed in the way they handled things and treat their customers. They will be sending me out a letter explaining why they closed my account.

Amerihome was the servicer for my mortgage loan for most of 2023 ( until XX/XX/2023 ) and had issued a check in the amount of {$860.00} for my annual home insurance costs. This check was cut on XX/XX/2023, and the home insurance policy was set to expire on XX/XX/2023. After receiving notice of my policy being cancelled from my home insurance company on XX/XX/XXXX. Initially calling Amerihome after receiving the cancellation notice, I was told the funds were wired to the XXXX. After going back and forth with the carrier, my insurance broker, and Amerihome, Amerihome told me on XX/XX/XXXX, that the funds were not wired, it was sent via check ( check # XXXX ). After following advice from Amerihome, they said it could take approx 10 business days for the check to be cleared by my home insurance company, even though they knew it was sent to the wrong address. They stated that they could not put a stop payment on the check. I repeatedly told them it was going to the wrong address and I worried that the check would be cashed by someone else other than my home insurance company. In the meantime, Amerihome sold my mortgage loan to XXXX XXXX in XXXX of 2023. \n\nAfter my home insurance XXXX had still not received the funds, it was finally acknowledged that Amerihome sent the funds to the wrong address ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) on XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXhe correct address XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TX XXXX. Ultimately, Amerihome told me that the new mortgage lender would have to resolve this issue. In the meantime of all of this, I was without home insurance coverage on my house until XX/XX/XXXX, because I was then at that point able to pay 2 months worth of coverage out of pocket so my home insurance company could reinstate my policy to ensure I didn't continue going without a policy on my house. \n\nAdditionally on XX/XX/XXXX, Amerihome told me the next step is to have XXXX send their yearly premium invoice with the correct address for remittance to XXXX. I had to go to XXXX to view the insurance information and have my insurance broker try to fix this via an email. So in doing what we thought was right, on XX/XX/XXXX, my insurance company uploaded all the documents as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX instructed us to do so. Ultimately, we never heard back from XXXX  regarding anything. Again, I had to go back to contact XXXX XXXX and Amerihome to try and resolve this. \n\nFast forward to today ( XX/XX/2023 ), I called XXXX XXXX  who is now servicing my loan to discuss about stopping a payment on the check, XXXX have previously been told by Amerihome that XXXX XXXX is the only one who can handle this, and much to common sense, XXXX XXXX didn't have access to the check, therefore couldn't put a stop payment in place. So I had to call Amerihome back and talk to different customer service reps who told me that there wasn't anything that can be done since my loan with Amerihome was closed due to it being bought out. \n\nAfter calling today ( XX/XX/2023 ) and being bounced around from automation, to standard over seas customer service reps, I was finally able to be escalated to a supervisor, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  initially told me there wasn't anything he can do, and that it was on XXXX XXXX to figure this out.

This matter has been brought to Credit Acceptance attention regarding the various inaccuracies on several occasions especially since I have been disputing the accuracy of this account for the past several months which I have a copy of every single letter to prove it along with the letters from the bureaus stating the account has been verified which I cant see how an account has been verified as accurate with so many discrepancies being reported for the same account to different credit reporting agencies.\n\nLets also take into consideration the date of last activity which is also among the several different discrepancies that is being reported from this one account.

I was given the terms and documentation needed to process my application. Over the past week or so I submitted the requested documents as need or as they became available to me. I spoke to the loan processor on couple of occasions, to give updated or he is giving me updates on additional information needed to process my application.one of the requested documentation was child support order, which I provided to them. Later on, I was asked to provide the 2nd page of the child support order. The second page to the divorce papers did not have anything to do with the child support order, which I advise them of that, however they still wanted page 2 of the divorce papers, so I provided to them. Couple days later they start asking for things I felt was not relevant for the processing of my application. I question the loan processor and was told that they believe that the second page of the divorce paper I sent was pretty much fake and believe it did not come from the divorce paper but came from somewhere else. The second issue was they asked for the proof of child support payment coming from the payee. I had the payee provided me with a 6-month history of wire transfer child support from his Bank of America account to my Bank of America account . Then they said that's not good enough we need to have proof that it went into your account, even-tho the wire transfer clearly shows the transfer coming from the payee account with his name and information to my account with my name and information. As time goes by it seems like they start asking for things that is impossible for me to provide them with or information of private and person nature. I asked the processor at one point, what are they allow legally to ask for because I felt they are beating around the bush to get thigs they are not legally allow to ask for but is finding a way to get it without straight out asking for what they trying to get. Then they said the property is not appraising where it needs to be. I asked for their appraisal and was told it's not available because a true appraisal was not done. At this point pretty much all the things they keep on asking for was provided to them, they also wanted a Proft and lost statement. I was not sure why a Proft and lost because I am a realtor not a business owner. I did provide it to them. Then they asked for my ex-husband to sign an Authorization to release information. I question them on the reason why he would need to sign that form when he is not applying with me and was told that they need information and the mortgage. I said I already provided you the mortgage statement and anything else you need can be obtain my you the bank as to the evidence of title. I told them that my ex-husband will not sign that form. The loan processor stated he will consult with his manager and get back with me. I received a call back from the loan office stated that they can not process the application if my ex-husband doesn't sign the form. I asked again why he would need to sign the form if he is not applying with me, I was then told that they need to see if he had any late mortgage payment. I stated that if he had any late payments that should have no bearing on my ability because I am the one getting the loan and my credit is the only credit that is being used. I also mention that I am not on the mortgage, and from my understanding all my ex-husband would have to do is sign the paperwork at closing acknowledging that I am taking out a loan. I was then told that if he had any lates on the mortgage that it will not be counted against me, well if that is the case why do he need to sign the authorization to release form. Then I was told that they need to know the kind of mortgage and the interest rate in order to proceed with the application. I said I am lost, I thought was important was to make sure the mortgage is current and there is no lien and any negative issue that would affect you extending the credit. It seems like anything I told them is impossible to provide is what they say they have to have to procced with the loan. Then they ask for the full divorce decree, I advise them that there is private and sensitive information in it that I am not at liberty to disclose to them regarding my ex-husband. I also offer to provide whatever they need specifically form the divorce decree. But of course, they stated that they want the full divorce decree and for him to sign the authorization to release information in order to continue with the application.

As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, I see that there is a collection item on my XXXX credit report for SUNRISE CREDIT SERVICES GROUP with a balance of {$310.00}. For several years leading up to XX/XX/XXXX, I had been using XXXX XXXX XXXX for both mobile and internet services and I switched both to XXXX for internet on XX/XX/XXXX and mobile on XX/XX/XXXX. I had an XXXX XXXX XXXX modem that I returned using the instructions I found on XXXX XXXX XXXX website which required returning to a XXXX store. I have a receipt from the XXXX store for the return of the XXXX XXXX XXXX equipment dated XX/XX/XXXX. The XXXX receipt has a return reference number and the device serial and model number included on document this receipt is attached to this issue. I tried on many occasions to cancel both mobile and internet services with XXXX XXXX XXXX by phone, but was told that I needed a PIN that they gave me when I started using the service multiple years earlier. I did not have the PIN and they told me I could not cancel service without it. They suggested I go to a specific XXXX XXXX XXXX store to authenticate myself to them so I could get the PIN. I visited the exact store they specified and the store manager told me that they don't do anything like that there. The store manager gave me a phone number to call and I called and it was the same routine where in order to cancel services I needed a PIN that I did not have. I asked the XXXX XXXX XXXX operator if they had an email address, website or mailing address where I could send documents that proved I stopped using their internet services on XX/XX/XXXX, and stopped using the mobile service on XX/XX/XXXX and returned the modem on XX/XX/XXXX. They said they did not have any email address, or web address or mailing address that would accept any such documents. It appears to me that XXXX XXXX XXXX is making it difficult if not impossible, for a customer to cancel a service and they further continue billing and turn these improperly billed amounts over to collection agencies. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a debt collector, stating I owed {$310.00} to XXXX XXXX and I responded on XX/XX/XXXX with a letter containing this explanation as well as documents proving that I returned the modem and had attempted on several occasions to notify XXXX XXXX XXXX that I was no longer using the service. Then on XX/XX/XXXX I received another letter from a different entity, Sunrise Credit Services saying I owe XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$310.00}. I responded with another letter dated XX/XX/XXXX which enclosed the letter I had provided to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Note that at the time I stopped using the XXXX XXXX XXXX service in XX/XX/XXXX, I had a combined mobile and internet package with XXXX XXXX XXXX where I paid a mobile bill each month and the internet service was free as long as I had the combined mobile and internet accounts. I stopped using internet on XX/XX/XXXX and mobile on XX/XX/XXXX. I also was unable to cancel my XXXX XXXX XXXX mobile service and XXXX XXXX XXXX continued to send me bills for complete months of mobile service long after my mobile phone number and service had been moved to XXXX. The bills from XXXX XXXX XXXX for mobile service for the time subsequent to my transfer to XXXX went to a different credit collection agency named XXXX XXXX XXXX. I sent Credence a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX and also paid them {$17.00} for a few days of mobile service that I did owe XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( an amount I calculated myself because I could never get anyone at XXXX XXXX XXXX to send me a final bill just for the last few days that I used the service ).

No one at my work received a call looking for me. Not only am I on the company directory where they could have reached me, but the phone rings at my desk when an outside call is made. \nThe only conclusion I can come up with is that because they did not ring through to the operator nor did they try contacting me on the phone tree.

Under the FDCPA, if you request validation of a debt within 30 days of receiving the initial communication from a debt collector, the collector must provide you with certain information, including a written verification of the debt, if requested. However, this does not necessarily require the collector to provide the original signed contract or \" wet documents.

The response from Truist is not accurate and fails to include pertinent details. XXXX, who obtained the mortgage, passed away on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX  sister, XXXX, is the successor of her estate. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, VA appointed me as guardian/conservator of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. This was prior to BB & T and Suntrust Banks merging to become Truist Bank. XXXX  and XXXX had accounts with both banks. BB & T immediately accepted the legal documents, acknowledged XXXX death, XXXX as XXXX successor, and me as XXXX 's guardian/conservator allowing me to manage both XXXX XXXX and XXXX 's BB & T accounts. Suntrust refused to accept the legal documents and to acknowledge XXXX as XXXX successor and me as XXXX  guardian/conservator. I delivered the legal documents in-person and via mail on numerous occasions to no avail. Telephone calls to Suntrust, and then, Truist, resulted in me being told that Suntrust/Truist could only confer with XXXX  ( deceased ), and I could not be provided any information about the loan. Due to their refusal to confer with me, I had no knowledge that the insurance policy had lapsed. Based on Truists statement, the insurance policy was cancelled on XX/XX/XXXX, two months after XXXXXXXX XXXX death. XXXX 's death prevented her from paying the insurance premium and Suntrusts/Truists refusal to confer with me resulted in my inability to pay the insurance premium or obtain a new insurance policy upon my appointment as guardian and conservator of XXXX. I became aware of the insurance lapse when the mortgage bill to XXXX  noted that new insurance was purchased at an unreasonable price. I then immediately purchased and paid for insurance with XXXX effective XX/XX/XXXX, noting Truist as the Mortgage Company. Truist cancelled the more expensive insurance but continued including insurance escrow in the monthly payment. Hence, the insurance lapse was not the result of my inability or refusal to pay insurance but was due to Truists failure to acknowledge XXXX as the successor of XXXX  and me as XXXX  Guardian/Conservator, allowing me to obtain information about the loan. \n\nPrincipal and interest of the load is {$360.00}. In its response, Truist states at this time, the loan is not being escrowed for taxes. That statement is false. Please see attached mortgage account statements dated XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, stating that {$380.00} is being escrowed for taxes and insurance thereby making the total monthly payment {$740.00}. Please also see attached insurance bill which shows yearly insurance amount as {$2200.00} or {$190.00} per month. The escrowed amount of {$380.00} equates to {$4500.00} yearly, much more than the yearly cost of the yearly home insurance being paid. If the loan is not being escrowed for taxes, then why is the payment still showing that taxes are being escrowed and why is an additional {$190.00} being withheld? Please see the attached two most recent tax payment receipts showing said payments were made by me, not Truist. \n\nTruist previously put the property up for auction after repeatedly refusing to acknowledge XXXX as successor and me as guardian/conservator. It was only after my initial complaint with CFPB that Truist acknowledged XXXX as successor and me as guardian/conservator. A lot of unnecessary money was spent to stop the auction. This is yet another attempt by Truist to force foreclosure on this property. Truist needs to acknowledge that its repeated failure to acknowledge XXXX as successor and me as guardian/conservator resulted in the lengthy insurance lapse, not XXXX 's XXXX my inability or refusal to pay for insurance ; cease taking out escrow for taxes and explain the {$380.00} escrow being charged ; and return the monthly payment to its original amount of {$360.00}.

I believe any denial should rightfully attach what was specifically denied. Essentially I was reviewed based upon income and credit credits credit already established. I would like to make sure these figures are correctly posted so I can verify if any information is inaccurate. I was unable to see this even with a password protected denial thus only generic information exists as if it is a concern for the consumer credit bureau. I would need to verify full info and specifics when comparing to any outside information. \n\n2 ) I might have input a monthly income total instead of yearly total income on the application. I am unable to verify as to correct or refile a new application or appeal.\n\n3 ) Based on the application that this is generic in nature. If denied I should be able to appeal as to showcase the net worth of myself as to show that I have the ability to pay. Lack of net worth is discriminatory in-nature because it relies on income rather than recognize a person could have received a lump sum payment for government assistance or already has money saved thus has the ability to pay. Income is discriminatory in nature because the application is generic such does not recognize where the income is derived from as more secure than income received from an employer if received from the federal government and also one can not be considered unemployed if receiving certain type of benefits from the government. Thus these factors were not weighed as discriminatory to provide generic income understandings on the application not pegged to a certain reason of where the income is coming from. \n\n4 ) The credit application is discriminatory in nature where they showcase income but do not recognize the income as if it pertains to a person receiving government assistance income or like SSA income. I believe other credit cards require you to disclose employment status or government assistance program supplying income and this application is quite generic and did not allow understandings of where the income is coming from. \n\n5 ) I do have a chase account with benefits. Because Good Year Credit card application is mainly a website application rather than offer perks of phone app application that I believe Good Year is recognizing benefits are similar and does not want to provide a credit card where my credit score is good and I have been paying off all credit card debt responsibly thus good year credit card perks are for 6 months deferral of payment thus I believe it is discriminatory to recognize credit card debt as if I am not paying this off correctly as to have a good credit score with the debt obligation thus good year does not want to supply credit card perks of payment deferral because I might be receiving perks on the other credit car which I am successfully paying off thus wrongfully assumes I do not deserve this credit card and perks until I paid off the full debt which is discriminatory in-nature because credit cards compete on XXXX XXXX and that if I have been receiving XXXX XXXX for quite some time that thus credit card application exploits this perk as if I have not been accruing income or have a higher net worth to pay off the debt thus XXXX XXXX is a discriminatory factor among obtaining new credit cards because good year allows 6 month deferral at the XXXX XXXX rate essentially such I would have the ability to pay off debt per my income and net worth or cash readily available as part of my net worth. XXXX XXXX credit card applications thus are discriminatory to recognize any debt obligations are per other perks of credit card which does not showcase that I am unable to pay the credit card correctly but only showcases that payment is not due immediately thus a debt obligation on a XXXX XXXX credit card is discriminatory because I do not have an obligation to pay immediately thus good will would accrue because I was accepted by a competition credit card company to allow XXXX XXXX for longer than XXXX year thus compared to a year of XXXX XXXX that any obligation is quite low but I did not see any specifics noted on these denial thus is discriminatory because good will is achieved by have XXXX XXXX and good credit score as to pay only a required monthly payment. Thus good year discriminates against those who have good credit and good credit terms of XXXX XXXX because a debt obligation does not exist as if I need to pay immediately as to be in jeopardy but is a sign of good will that I am paying off the debt correctly with a XXXX XXXX credit card and that if a XXXX XXXX is ending that it would be appropriate to try good year at their XXXX XXXX and recognize my debt obligation with the previous credit card will be cleared once payment is required to be made after the XXXX XXXX ends per the credit agreement. Thus good year is discriminatory as to showcase a generic credit card application as to entrap their victims with a 6 month XXXX XXXX but fail to recognize the debt obligation is essentially covered and is not a concern for poor credit but excellent credit because the terms allows XXXX XXXX to exist thus without a required payment necessary that debt obligation does not truly exist as if I am missing any payments or paying late. I believed this was an I correct denial to boost their credit reputation against competition thus perks should only be received at XXXX credit card line rather than recognizing that I can transfer to a XXXX XXXX credit card upon a XXXX credit XXXX credit card ending. The former credit card did not allow a renewal of XXXX XXXX thus I can transfer to a new credit card without worry about credit card obligation because the due date shows that I am not required to pay but I am continuously paying off the credit card either way. The denial was too simple and discriminatory as a concern for a generic application to only allow XXXX XXXX for those who do not already have XXXX XXXX as to showcase no debt in most cases owed to a credit card which is also anticompetitive because XXXX XXXX is a staple or marketing ploy that allows a person to sign up but can essentially take on a new credit card upon XXXX XXXX ending even though debt is still not obligated to be paid in full as to transfer to a new credit card without need to transfer debt to the new credit card. Thus a Chase credit card allows a long term XXXX XXXX thus good year will void credit card applications incorrectly as to show bad will upon other competitors offering XXXX XXXX as well and that the debt obligation is not truly owed until payment is due thus credit score is still good which was clearly not reflected with the debt of this credit card that this is good debt not bad debt regardless of how much debt a person has because the debt does not exist until it is required to be paid thus monthly debt is nit required by the chase credit card on a XXXX XXXX plan thus I should not be having bad will or bad faith understandings if good year is exploiting the XXXX XXXX understanding as to require me to pay off the debt in full before receiving a new credit card with the previous credit card company. Discriminatory in nature because it is responsible to sign up for XXXX XXXX thus debt is not accounted for correctly if debt obligations are still under a XXXX XXXX plan where the monthly requirement is not an obligation at all and thus should not be a detriment to my credit quality or score as to not be required to pay and any insinuations of having to pay off the debt before receiving a new credit card for like XXXX XXXX terms is discriminatory in nature as XXXX XXXX is exploited to deny credit card applications wrongfully. \n\n\nDenied on XX/XX/2023", "answer": "#### Credit card"}, {"question": "My car is in the shop for warranty repair on XX/XX/2023 and Car-Mart keeps lying to me about when it will be ready.

In the wallet was my Government XXXX XXXX, issued by Citi. This is the card which I am to use when making purchases when on official travel. \n\nThe thief ran up {$1700.00} in unauthorized purchases in the time ( roughly 1 hour ) between when he/she stole my wallet and when Citi deactivated the card due to suspected fraudulent activity. \n\nCiti has claimed that I am responsible for these charges because the thief used my PIN in making the purchases. They have cited a portion of the card agreement which states, essentially, that if I give my card and PIN to someone, then I am responsible for anything that they then do with the card. However, this is not what happened. Both the card and PIN were stolen. As for how the thief knew the PIN, I can only assume that he/she either surreptitiously watched me enter it, or obtained it using a keyboard overlay. \n\nI was immediately in touch with Citi upon receiving a text message from them reporting the suspected fraud. Receiving this text message is what confirmed for me that my wallet and card were stolen, and not simply misplaced. During this initial call, I arranged with Citi for a new card to be expedited to me, and also confirmed that all transactions beyond a certain one ( the last purchase I made before my wallet was stolen ) should be flagged as fraudulent. \n\nAfter a couple of weeks, I checked my online account and noticed that the fraudulent charges were still on my statement, and that my balance owed included those fraudulent charges. I called Citi a second time to get an explanation of this. I was told that the fraudulent charges would take \" 1-2 billing cycles '' to be removed. But in the process of that call, the agent I spoke with once again went through the transactions with me, saying that she was flagging them as fraudulent so that they would be \" investigated. '' This was confusing to me, as it indicated that the first person I spoke hadn't done so, and that perhaps Citi had done nothing at all about the issue to that point. She also asked me, interrogation style, why I didn't file a police report, and how the thief had learned my PIN. \n\nI later received a letter from Citi, dated XX/XX/2023, in which they rejected my dispute, citing the cardholder agreement as I mentioned above. The letter contained an itemized list of transactions which I had reportedly disputed, but it wasn't even the full list of fraudulent transactions. So over 2 phone calls in which I went over the fraudulent charges with Citi representatives, they still didn't even manage to have the full list. \n\nIn the midst of all this, I decided to ask my employer ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) to get involved, going through the Government XXXX XXXX department for my agency. They are reportedly in the process of disputing the charges with Citi, and as far as I know these communications are ongoing.

The Supervisor proceeded to put me on trial for being frauded out of my own money. He questioned why I did not immediately report the fraud. When I explained that I did not check my account daily to notice this was taken then he responded with telling me how if it was his account he would have immediately noticed. He then questioned why I did not notice the fraud and report it when I made a XXXX payment one day from the account.

As I was attempting to add the card to XXXX XXXX as it requests in the app as part of the setup steps it asked to verify by sending a text to the phone number on file. I selected that option and never received the text. I tried to have them call and never received the call. I then called in to have them add the card to XXXX XXXX where they requested to call a landline which I dont have a landline to receive the code. They asked to call back later to get a verification code which I did and they called me back on my same number using call waiting and added it to XXXX XXXX. The representative said the card was unlocked and the fraud block lifted. After making a couple purchases on the card it got marked with a fraud alert again. I called back in and they asked if I had another bank account with citi I could verify with as well as a bank account I use to pay Citi which I did not have added yet. The only resolution has been to send a letter to my mailing address which will take 4-7 or 7-10 business days depending on which Citi rep you are talking to. They are preventing me from using my card as agreed on and they have not been able to tell me at all why the card was flagged as they were normal purchases they asked about and now the fraud block requires a different verification. The citi fraud team has been entirely unhelpful and the methods of verification dont have anything to do with my identity another landline apart from the number I applied for the account with shouldnt be the only alternate route to verify and I can provide ID background info etc but they are not consistent with the options I have to verify from one call to the next. I have requested a supervisor and it has been a terrible experience so far working with them. Part of the reason I applied for the card is due to the bonus miles from using the card but I am unable to spend on the card to achieve the bonus without access to my actual card so it feels a lot like a bait and switch so far. \n\nMy ideal resolution to this would be that they are able to verify my identity so I can use the card and not wait for verification through mail in 7-10 business days when I just received the card to the same mailing address within the last 3 days so another piece of mail sent just proves I am at that address recieving mail but I obviously am if I have the card in my possession and activated it when they sent it to that address.", "answer": "#### Credit card"}, {"question": "I have a promotional 6 month APR XXXX XXXX for A few purchases.

I believe WF is fraudulently denying my credit usage in an attempt to make me so disgusted with them that I cancel this account. \n\nWF has such a bad reputation, well eatrned by their criminal action in the past that someone at WF needs to be prosecuted and imprisoned to make the rest behave in honest treatment of customers.\n\nThere is no excuse for not informing me of what is being done and why it is necessary. Denial of service when I have done all I can to assist in this fraud prosecution is an insult that must not be allowed to continue. If they are doing this as a corporate policy to all customers then you need to prosecute or warn others that this is how WF treats customers and put them out of business of defrauding the public by advertising credit and customer service they do not provide.\n\nI would appreciate restoration of my servic and account that is long overdue and should not have happened in the first place. Whoever attempted this was so ignorant of credit charges they were obviouly attempting a fraud that the WF authorizer declined the charge.

Our mortgage company XXXX Freedom Mortgage ) paid our taxes in XXXX of XXXX. We did not receive an escrow analysis until XXXX of XXXX which reflected an escrow shortage of {$1200.00}. Payment was made in the full amount of the shortage in XXXX of XXXX. We then received a second escrow analysis in XXXX of XXXX in the amount of {$1100.00}. When we reached out to Freedom Mortgage we were told that the original analysis in XXXX was incorrect and this was the correct one leaving us with an extra {$100.00} we had paid, which we asked to have allocated to our principal. We then received a third and fourth analysis in XXXX. XXXX which reflected only our required minimum balance and one which reflected a shortage of {$100.00} ( the difference between the first and second analysis ). We reached out again and over the course of several days/hours finally had the {$100.00} re-allocated to the escrow shortage as they then said the original one for {$1200.00} was correct. We were told that the analysis had been run in error, that Florida was a state that was mandated by the federal requirement to run in XXXX and that it was because of when we closed on our home. We continued with out issue until this year. Our XXXX analysis was done on XX/XX/XXXX and showed a {$3300.00} shortage. We elected to have the payments for the shortage spread out over the the next 12 months with the first increased monthly payment starting on XX/XX/XXXX. Since XX/XX/XXXX we have paid our full mortgage payment including {$820.00} to escrow, of which {$270.00} is supposed to be covering our shortage spread. As of our XX/XX/XXXX statement I noticed that the full amount of our escrow payment has been allocated to the escrow balance. I did notice this until XXXX of XXXX at which point I reached out again to Freedom to confirm if this was correct. I spent over an hour on the phone trying to verify if they had in fact been recouping the shortage amount. My issue was escalated to escrow, I was told I could not speak directly with anyone in escrow but that I could send a message through our online account. I received an email and noticed an alert that said I had an escrow analysis ready. Upon further investigation my upcoming payment was reflected as {$55.00} less than my current payment as per an escrow analysis done on XX/XX/XXXX that reflected a {$1800.00} shortage. I attempted to reach via phone on XX/XX/XXXX and spent XXXX hours on the phone of which I spoke to someone for approximately XXXX minutes. I was repeatedly placed on hold only to have a new person pick up. I finally ended the call at approx. XXXX XXXX XXXX minutes after they closed having \" spoken '' to XXXX people.I did send a message via the portal. XXXX XXXX reached out to my husband via phone on XX/XX/XXXX. My husband attempted to discuss the issue with her but was told the {$1800.00} shortage was due to our insurance increase and she did not discuss the original issue of if the previous shortage was being allocated. I reached out via email to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and explained that I am the one who reached out and the one who pays the mortgage so I would be the better point of contact. XXXX reached out via phone later that same day where we spoke for well over an hour. I repeatedly stated that we had never asked for an escrow analysis to be done only to have the account looked at to make sure that the XXXX XXXX shortage was actually being applied. I was repeatedly told the issue was due to our insurance going up and us switching and not having paid them the original dispersed amount. They dispersed to our former insurance company on XX/XX/XXXX and then to our current insurance company on XX/XX/XXXX. The former also repaid the funds paid to them on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX repeatedly insisted that I was incorrect, even telling me that they don't have phrasing in their payment history of \" funds recieved '' until I offered to email it to her. I again stated that I only wanted to verify the shortage of {$3300.00} was being recouped properly. At the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX assured me that they were recouping properly even though my escrow balance reflected as though they had been placing the entire {$820.00} into the escrow account and that they would cancel the analysis done on XX/XX/XXXX with my payment remaining the same as it had been since XX/XX/XXXX. I asked for documentation via email and a letter of what had been allocated to our shortage and was told that I would get a letter that stated they had been recouping it. To date I have not obtained that information. On XX/XX/XXXX I logged in to pay our mortgage and noticed that I had a banner alert of an escrow shortage. When I reached the payment screen I had the option to pay the shortage in full. I selected this option to see what it was and the amount displayed was {$3300.00} the amount of our shortage from our analysis done XX/XX/XXXX. I called in when Freedom opened at XXXX XXXX and was connected to XXXX who did not provide ID number. XXXX repeatedly insisted the {$1800.00} was an error, that we had gotten a letter and refused to look at the XX/XX/XXXX analysis. I was placed on hold 3 times, the XXXX time I was not even told about the hold and held for approx. XXXX minutes. After that hold period she came back on and asked how she could assist today as though she did not realize she was still connected with me. I finally asked her to please transfer to someone else if she was unable/unwilling to assist as it is incredibly awful to just be placed on hold in the hopes you'll give up when you have called for assistance. I was transferred to Aapria ID # XXXX and we spoke at length at which time she told me that she was unable to find record of anything being paid to our shortage outside of the payment I made last XXXX despite XXXX making our payment including the shortage spread in full each month. I still do not have a clear answer on if they have allocated the spread or if they will have to take it out of our current balance which will trigger another shortage for the upcoming year.

This complaint revolves around Synchrony 's transaction reporting violations, invasive breaches of privacy, and disregard for consumer rights.\n\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 USC 1681 section 602 ( a ), underscores the paramount need for consumer reporting agencies to fulfill their responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a profound respect for consumers ' privacy rights. This principle is further echoed in 15 USC 6801, which mandates that every financial institution, including Synchrony, has an affirmative and ongoing obligation to uphold customer privacy and safeguard the security and confidentiality of nonpublic personal information.\n\nHowever, my complaint centers on Synchrony 's transaction reporting violations, unauthorized inquiries, and their disregard for privacy rights. As per 15 USC 1681 section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ), consumer reporting agencies may furnish a consumer report solely \" in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates.

This represents a clear violation of federal regulations. Notably, 15 USC 1681C ( a ) ( 5 ) mandates that no consumer reporting agency may compile a consumer report containing adverse information without proper authorization. Synchrony reported adverse information without my consent, thus violating federal law.\n\nAdditionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( A ) specifies that a person shall not furnish information to a consumer reporting agency if they know or have reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. Synchrony has furnished inaccurate information, leading to harm and potential financial consequences for consumers. \n\nMoreover, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, the consumer reporting agencies, have failed to maintain reasonable procedures, as required by 15 U.S. Code 1681e. These agencies have reported inaccurate and inconsistent information, causing harm and confusion. \n\nIn light of these severe violations, I request the CFPB conducts a thorough investigation into Synchrony 's actions, encompassing transaction reporting violations, encroachments on privacy, and disregard for consumer rights.

Furthermore, I would like to emphasize that I have never provided written consent to any consumer reporting agency to report the disputed items on my consumer report.

My name is XXXX XXXX, and I am the owner of XXXX XXXX, with an address at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX. \n\nOn XX/XX/2023, I opened a Business Checking Account with Santander Bank at the XXXX XXXX, in-person, with an initial deposit of {$5000.00}. I chose Santander Bank because of its proximity to my business and a promotional offer that required maintaining a {$5000.00} balance for 90 days to receive a {$500.00} bonus. \n\nHowever, on approximately XX/XX/2023, I received a letter via XXXX Mail notifying me of the abrupt closure of my business account, which had only been open for a short time.

Unfortunately, the customer service representative I spoke with was uncooperative and could not provide me with a clear timeline for the return of my funds. I requested an expedited refund of my deposit, but the response I received was vague, leaving me uncertain about when I would receive my funds. Santander Bank has held my funds for over 1.5 months, causing me significant financial stress and frustration.\n\nI would like to emphasize that my request for a business checking account did not involve seeking any credit facility from the bank. The abrupt closure of my account has had a negative impact on my credit report, as it now shows that the account was opened on XX/XX/2023, and closed within a month. This adverse information will create suspicion among potential financial lenders and negatively affect my financial standing for the next five years.\n\nI believe that I and my business have not been treated fairly by Santander Bank, and I request compensation for the loss of the promotional bonus, the time wasted in the account-opening process, and the frustration caused by this ordeal. Furthermore, I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate this matter thoroughly and ensure that Santander Bank addresses these issues promptly and appropriately. \n\nBank took into consideration attached report from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I do not see any problem in the report. Report is attached. \n\n\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this complaint and your efforts to protect the rights and interests of consumers.

From the very beginning, Barclays has clearly demonstrated an unwillingness to fairly adjudicate this matter. Despite touting their liability protection on purchases for business customers, Barclays continues to manufacture a variety of excuses to avoid dealing with this dispute claim. From account representatives in the dispute department, to agents assigned to investigate, to supervisors who can not be reached directly, to the Office of The President, there is no accountability at any level of the company. \n\nFor some context, I am a long-time Barclays JetBlue cardholder .

I have ample documentation, which I have provided to investigators working on the XXXX disputes. However, just a few days after filing the dispute with Barclays, I received a denial letter dated XX/XX/XXXX ( attached ). An investigation was never opened. The verdict read : \" services were rendered... the merchant is due payment. '' Not exactly a thorough investigation. As this case was escalated, Barclays kept switching the excuse. The second reason, now presented to me as official letters from the Office of the President, ( attached ) asserts XXXX does not offer dispute rights on these transactions. That would mean XXXX has a different standard for Visa and MasterCard when it comes to disputing charges. XXXX categorically denies this. Given my experience with Visa disputes for the exact same merchant, exact same payment method for the exact same job, I also know this is completely false. The third excuse claims the method in which the XXXX payment was made violated XXXX terms and conditions and therefore is not disputable. I have spoken to XXXX at length.

Consequently, I formally revoke any and all consent, regardless of its form, be it verbal, non-verbal, written, implied, or conveyed by any other means, to XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and BESTBUY/CBNA. Furthermore, my complaint extends to the inaccuracies in XXXX 's credit reports. 15 USC 1681e mandates that \" Every consumer reporting agency shall maintain reasonable procedures designed to avoid violations of section 1681c of this title. '' XXXX 's credit report inaccuracies, particularly concerning inquiries, violate these procedures.

Then there is the fact that she played along like my application was still being considered on XX/XX/XXXX when I was told by the customer service representative that I was already denied 4 days prior.

Without telling me why they require the maximum reserve allowed in my account. \n\n\nSubject: Escalation to the CPFB of Escrow Account Concern -\nResponse Clarification Dear Wells Fargo Home Mortgage and CFPB\nofficers, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing in response to\nyour recent communication regarding my concerns about the significant\nincrease in my escrow account, as well as the addition of a new twomonth escrow reserve. First and foremost, I would like to thank you for\nproviding me with additional details regarding the breakdown of the\nescrow increase, as outlined in your analysis on Page 2, Part 2 of Wells\nFargo XXXX XXXX. It is evident that the increase of XXXX\ncomprises two distinct components: XXXX for the estimated increase in\ntax and insurance and an entirely new XXXXXXXX minimum escrow\nbalance equivalent to two months of escrow payments. While I\nappreciate the clarification on the first component related to tax and\ninsurance, I would like to emphasize that the primary focus of my initial\ncomplaint centered on the addition of the new XXXX two-month\nescrow cushion/reserve. Unfortunately, your response did not address\nthis critical concern. Regarding the tax and insurance component, based\non your explanation, the escrow increase should have amounted to\nXXXX XXXX XXXX. However, the actual increase I\nexperienced was XXXX, signifying a substantial discrepancy. What\ndeeply concerns me is the addition of the new XXXX two-month\nescrow cushion/reserve. This matter raises serious questions and warrants\nfurther investigation for the following reasons: 1A) Your response to the\nCPFB did not directly address why this two-month escrow cushion was\nadded at this time, merely acknowledging my concern about it. 1B) The\noriginal customer service contact on XXXX mislead me to believe\nthe 2 month additional reserve was a mandatory NJ law requirement and\nXXXX, XXXX XXXX Complaint Detail\nhttps://portal.consumerfinance.gov/consumer/s/complaint-XXXX XXXX\nnot a Maximum allowed by NJ. 2) In the current high-interest rate\nenvironment, customers face limitations in switching to other lenders,\npotentially placing them in a vulnerable position, which may be\nexploited. 3) While New Jersey laws permit such a two-month cushion, it\nis unlikely that Wells Fargo currently requires these funds for any\nimmediate purposes. This is akin to raising a deposit account's minimum\nbalance from a few hundred dollars to XXXX. However, it's important\nto note that the costs associated with switching my mortgage to another\nbank are currently prohibitively high. 4) As an individual with a\nbackground in compliance for financial services and an MS in\nAccounting, I can attest that the average person may find it challenging to\ncomprehend the intricacies of these calculations, rendering them more\nsusceptible to abusive practices. 5) There appears to be a discriminatory\npractice against existing customers, as it is likely that Wells Fargo will not\nimpose this two-month reserve requirement on new mortgages to remain\ncompetitive in the market for new mortgages, creating an inequitable\nsituation. Effectively, this additional unjustified reserve of XXXX\nimplies that Wells Fargo will profit from the interest earned on this\namount while providing no compensation to the customer. It is akin to\nmaintaining an account with a minimum balance of XXXX, where the\nbank pays no interest to the account holder. To resolve this issue\nsatisfactorily, I kindly request the removal of the additional XXXX\nreserve from your analysis, as it appears unjustified by any current cash\nflow payments out of the escrow account. I believe that this adjustment is\nnecessary to rectify the situation and align it with fair and transparent\nbanking practices. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and\nlook forward to a resolution that ensures equity and compliance with\nrelevant market conduct expectations and regulations.

I have been making payments in the amounts of {$250.00} - {$600.00} or more to pay the transfer balance in full by the expiration date. On XX/XX/XXXX I initiated another balance transfer in the amount of {$1500.00} which expires XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, I had a balance {$3300.00} remaining on the first transfer. On XX/XX/XXXX I made a {$500.00} payment with the expectation of it being applied to the first balance transfer due to expire in XX/XX/XXXX. However, my XX/XX/XXXX statement showed that my 2nd transfer had a balance of {$1100.00} although it had not even been a month since opening it and the first transfer had a balance of {$3000.00} which meant only {$220.00} of my {$500.00} had been applied. When I contacted Barclays, I was told the computer determines how payments were applied since both had a 0 %. I complained at that time they were forcing me to make accelerated payments ( paid {$2500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$950.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ) on both transfers to make sure I did not miss the XX/XX/XXXX expiration and that I should be refunded some, or all of, the second transfer fee since I was not getting the benefit of the promotion. I spoke with multiple employees to include a supervisor about the issue with no resolution and received the same reason that the computer decides how to apply the payments which they can not override, although the agreed with what I was saying. In speaking with customer service in XXXX I was told when within 60 days of the promotion expiration, the payments would be made to the promotion due to expire within 60 days. Yet as mentioned above the XXXX payment didnt go entirely to the XXXX expiring promotion, the computer elected to split the payment. I was also told the balance of on the {$6000.00} transfer was only {$370.00} yet that was not reflected on my XXXX statement. In reviewing my XX/XX/XXXX statement there was a balance of {$840.00} for the first transfer ( not {$370.00} as stated by customer service ), so I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$950.00} to ensure the first promotion was paid in full prior to expiration on XX/XX/XXXX. I then called Customer Service the same day and was told they saw the payment pending and told me my promotional balance was {$370.00}. It was not until this call that I questioned them about the discrepancy in the amount given by the agent and what was reflected on the statement, because I was assured previously my XXXX statement would have the updated balance. On this call customer service did some research and then told me the statement shows the amount subject to interest if not paid in full but is not the balance of the promotional transfers ( it's not clear from the statement how the balance subject to interest is determined ). I asked for written documentation of my transfer balances rather than having to rely on calling customer service, because the balance subject to interest is meaningless without knowing what balance needs to be paid. I was told that information can not be provided to me, it is only available to the company via their system. I find it COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE to not have written documentation about balances that I am paying on. Additionally, my balance for the {$1500.00} transfer has changed from {$1100.00} on the XX/XX/XXXX statement back to {$1500.00} on the XX/XX/XXXX statement without explanation. I have no idea how Barclays is making decisions on these balances. My complaint is three-fold : ( 1 ) I should be able to have my payments applied, first, to the promotion that expires earliest and then the later promotion when both have the same 0 % APR, not be at the mercy of the arbitrary selection by their computer, ( 2 ) I should have written documentation of the balances I am paying on and ( 3 ) the amounts reflected on my statements have changed without explanation.

I may also add that I was told that they dont block credits to accounts yet I have it in writing, because I also spoke with their chat bot. Again terrible customer service. The merchant has confirmed with me multiple times and will not accommodate sending it again because they said it went through and because of the poor customer service which included hours of phone calls one which lasted 3 1/2 hours to the point where my phone couldnt even download it and save it.

In which we were instructed by insurance agent to return toward escrow upon receiving. First check we applied, but second one we recieved i wasnt able to pay on website because their website only allows one pending payment at a time. Which i then figured id apply it to our following mortgage payment. I believe this all started end of XXXX into XX/XX/2023. XXXX of XX/XX/2023 we recieved a escrow analysis stating our morgage payment was increasing almost {$400.00} a month, in which made me realize the escrow had to be messed up. Upon calling the mortgage company the employee on the phone said she didnt see any ecrow payment not even the {$730.00} made on XX/XX/2023 but she did see a payment for {$730.00}. I explained the {$730.00} was paid on the website to be applied to the escrow she said she would put in a request to fix the mistake, but then i explained that small amount shouldnt have change our escrow to that extreme. Her and I agreed there must have been 2 escrow payments made and she said she would request the payment of {$1800.00} from XX/XX/2023 also be applied to escrow. Upon reviewing documents with my insurance agent and on my own personal time i then remembered i never applied the second check and now they were requesting one of my mortgage payments to be applied to escrow. So then i contacted the mortgage customer service once again explained what i wanted to correct. {$2000.00} was the missing escrow payment, I asked for the {$1800.00} to repay my XX/XX/2023 mortgage payment that we reversed then asked for the remaining to be applied to the escrow. Fast forward to XX/XX/2023, I logged online to now schedule my XX/XX/2023 mortgage payment to find out they are stating my XX/XX/2023 payment was never made when in fact it was paid according to my checking account and their website on XX/XX/2023. I then proceeded to call their customer service, in which i was told multiple times they didnt see any mistakes then asked to speak to a supervisor who then said her customer service rep and herself reviewed all payments and see no error but I could email they research division with my concern to see if they can find the mistake. I did just that, everyday for multiple days. I tried contacting them the next day again to get a solution and once again was told they didnt have one and that research could take up to 48 hours to correct it. In which i stated XX/XX/2023 payment would be due soon and i didnt have time to wait to figure out whats going on. I was then transfered to 3 supervisors who all kept claiming to be the next persons superior before eventually being hung up on and never called back. Upon calling back and asking to speak to the last person i was on with i was told she wasnt available because she was in fact on a new call, funny because i was told if disconnected she would call me back. I then asked to be transfered to the manager who i was told I couldnt be directly connected to but i could leave a message and wait for a call back. So I then proceeded to leave a message for the Manager in which i was told was XXXX asking for a call back with a brief message in regards to my concerns, to this day havent heard from XXXX. On XX/XX/2023 I recieved a letter in the mail stating my XXXX payment was late and a late fee would be added. I then called customer service and asked how this is possible when they are still working on the issue, the rep chuckled stating she doesnt understand it either as she sees over {$6000.00} just floating not applied to anything and it would be more than enough to bring our mortgage up to date plus cover the escrow amount mailed to us. She then asked supervisors for permission to apply the money to the payments, in which she did now everything we had been arguing with them for months over seemed to be fixed. Nobody could answer me to whether they can reversed the negative report to my credit report or not, or whether my request to remove my PMI was approved for still awaiting to request a new escrow analysis to get our payment back to a normal dollar amount. We havent received ANY apology for their mistake nor has anybody even acknowledge the negative treatment we recieved during the past two months over this situation making it difficult for us to even want to stay with them as a mortgage company. Two months of stress and damage to our mental health and time lost with our precious children, and they see no guilt in any of it.

I wish to underscore that I did not authorize or consent to this transaction in any form or manner. \n\nMoreover, my concern deepens as I discovered that XXXX had conspicuously omitted essential legal and ethical obligations in their operations, which I believe violate both California and Federal Law. My efforts to communicate this issue with them have been met with resistance and evasion. \n\nKey Issues : Missing Terms of Service and Privacy Policies : XXXX failed to provide Terms of Service and Privacy Policies on their website at the time of signup, which is a critical requirement. I have attached documented evidence demonstrating this omission. \n\nFailure to Present Clear Auto-Renewal Terms : The auto-renewal offer terms, as mandated by law, were not presented clearly and conspicuously during the checkout process. This violates the requirement that such terms must be distinguishable, clear, and easily noticeable. \n\nLack of Post-Sale Acknowledgment : No post-sale acknowledgment, such as an email outlining the auto-renewal terms, was provided to me after enrolling with XXXX This is violation of California Law. \n\nAbsence of Cancellation Instructions : XXXX did not furnish me with any information on how to cancel the trial period, either during account creation, signup, or thereafter.

I have also filed a complaint with the attorney general that is currently under investigation. \n\nThe California Automatic Renewal Law prohibits sellers from charging consumers credit or debit cards for an automatic renewal plan without first obtaining the consumers affirmative consent. It also requires sellers to clearly and conspicuously1 present certain automatic renewal offer terms at the point of sale in close visual proximity to the request for consent to the offer. \n\nWherever the ARL requires clear and conspicuous disclosures, the required information must be presented in larger type than the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same size, or set off from the surrounding text of the same size by symbols or other marks, in a manner that clearly calls attention to the language. Their checkout process does not do this, and they are in violation. The text is smaller and in a XXXX  XXXX that easily blends in with the background during the checkout process. \nScreenshot XXXX at XXXX XXXX.XXXX  California Automatic Renewal Law requires sellers to deliver a separate post-purchase acknowledgment to the consumer in a retainable form ( such as email ) that clearly and conspicuously presents the same automatic renewal offer terms disclosed at the point of sale and further explains how the consumer can cancel the automatic renewal service.

The only communication I received after signing up was the following email : Screenshot XXXX at XXXX XXXXXXXXThe  California Automatic Renewal Law required for subscriptions sold online plans that include a free gift or trial must also explain how the consumer can cancel ( and allow the consumer to cancel ) before paying for any goods or services. The company provided no information on how I can go about canceling the free trial during the checkout process or after. Their terms of service and privacy policy pages were blank when I went to view them.

I was, of course, very skeptical of this, and remember doing some research at the time ( with no legal expertise or background ) and all I can really remember about my findings at the time is that they were positive, and that they had had rave reviews on various websites. The woman I spoke with, who claimed to be named XXXX, sounded to me, at the time, incredibly kind, informative, helpful, sweet, understanding, etc. I had many, many concerns at the time, and had been receiving a number of letters/offers for various \" debt relief '' programs that very clearly seemed to be scams, but for some reason, this one seemed different to me. \n\nI had around ~ {$15000.00} in debts total across 6 different credit cards. I had been paying those credit cards on a timely manner, and would have continued to do so had I not signed up for this program. \n\nI ended up agreeing to pay $ XXXX over the course of 2 years, receiving monthly phone call/appointments with XXXX to go over any new documentation I had received from debt collectors. I was told that if Elite DMS were unable to successfully dispute any of the accounts in question, I was A. Be entitled to reimbursement, or B. Be provided with legal representation at no extra cost. \n\nI was already in a desperate financial situation, and though I was not looking for any shortcuts or easy ways out of it ( as I stated before, I would have simply continued to pay off my debts as normal over a long period of time ), XXXX & Elite DMS were incredibly convincing, and I ended up signing up for ( what I thought to be ) an honest program that existed to protect consumers, despite it being a for profit company/institution ( as I was told ). \n\nFast forward to 2 years later, this past XX/XX/2023, I received a court summons from a debt collector/law firm that had bought the debt from one of my accounts. My fiance was actually the one to have been served, not me directly, as I was working that day, so I didn't get a chance to look at the documents until after business hours. Once I had realized that what I received was, in fact, a court summons, and that clearly, at least 1 of my 6 accounts had not been successfully disputed, I googled Elite DMS to find their phone number so I could get back in touch with them and get some guidance as to how to move forward/how to respond to the summons/etc. \n\nTo my utter dismay, shock, horror & disbelief, I saw a torrent of 1 star reviews of dozens and dozens of people crying \" SCAM!!! STAY FAR AWAY FROM ELITE DMS!!! \". I couldn't believe it. \n\nThe next day ( Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX ), and each following business day that week ( excluding Friday of that week ), I called every phone number I could find that was associated with Elite DMS. I got a call back on the 1st day from someone claiming to be named XXXX, who told me not to worry, and that someone from their legal team would be getting back to me shortly. Tuesday passed, I made a number of calls to Elite DMS, left voicemails, etc. Waited on hold with what I now assume to be a \" dummy '' \" dead end '' \" hold '', where a voice at the beginning says \" Our representatives are currently busy. Someone from Elite DMS will be with you shortly '' and waited 30 minutes in silence to no avail. Repeat same thing on Wednesday, and Thursday. \n\nFinally, on Thursday, I received a call from Elite DMS, but not from their legal team. I do not recall this person 's name, but they told me they would send me a form for reimbursement for the account that was not successfully disputed. I did not sign this form ( as I worry it would relieve them of accountability ). \n\nI have since revisited the contracts I had signed and I fear I have made a grave mistake. I have no idea what I got myself into, but I fear I have paid this company $ XXXX for what appears to be absolutely nothing, and it seems that several dozen other people have also fallen victim to what I presume to be a scam, that I *HOPE* to XXXX is breaking some sort of law here, so that I might have some sort of legal recourse or course of retaliation. \n\nToday is XX/XX/2023, and I repeated my same calling routine, trying to get in touch with SOMEONE at Elite DMS, to no avail. I will continue to do so the rest of the week. \n\n\nI had initially attached 6 documents to this, but then upon seeing that Elite DMS would see that it was me filing this complaint, I removed them out of fear of retaliation.

This complaint is also on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who has experienced similar issues with his account. Firstly, I have been charged a total of 15 overdraft fees within the last year, which I believe is an excessive and unfair practice. These charges have had a detrimental impact on my financial well-being and have caused significant harm to my financial stability. Furthermore, these overdraft charges were not foreseen or anticipated by me, as I have always maintained a sufficient available balance in my account to cover any transactions. Therefore, I contend that these charges are not only unjust but also illegal under the applicable laws and regulations. In addition to the aforementioned concerns, I must bring to your attention a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( 15 USC 1692d ) committed by the Bank. On XX/XX/2023, at XXXX XXXX., I received a call from XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX, which I later discovered was from the Bank 's debt collection department. During this call, profane and obscene language was used, causing me emotional distress and further harm. Such behavior is a clear violation of 15 USC 1692d ( 2 ) and is unacceptable. I hereby demand that all the overdraft charges imposed on my account be immediately removed, and the corresponding funds be returned to me without delay. Additionally, I am seeking compensation of {$1000.00} for each violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, as outlined in 15 USC 1692k. It is important to note that overdraft fee practices must comply with various laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), Regulation Z, Regulation E, and Section 1036 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ). These regulations prohibit unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices, particularly in relation to overdraft fees. Charging overdraft fees on transactions that a consumer would not reasonably anticipate is likely to be deemed unfair and can cause substantial harm to consumers. I urge the Bank to thoroughly investigate this matter and take immediate action to rectify the aforementioned issues. Failure to address these concerns in a satisfactory manner may leave me with no choice but to pursue legal remedies available to me. I expect a prompt response to this complaint within [ 14 days ] from the date of receipt of this letter. Please direct all correspondence regarding this matter to the address provided above ].

I filed a second complaint because I feel that the following points that based my complaint were totally missed and all you did was make yourself look good in the eyes of the XXXX XXXX agency. \n\nIn my second complaint, I let them know that the repayment plan is a total mistake, it was based on wrong information such as income and expenses. \nI emailed SPS a new income and expense worksheet which they totally ignored. \nAnother factor is that SPS totally ignored my hardship, currently I am suffering from XXXX and XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX which caused my income to decrease, SPS did not even mention this. \nThey never addressed the facts in why my assistance was withdrawn and why I am ineligible for other options. \nSPS never offered me any new plans or options for me to keep my home, all they do is blame it on the case and desist letter, but the fact is that they keep emailing the same old XXXX letters that are absolutely worthless. All they are doing is emailing me repeat letters every day of the week. I send them all back because they do not offer me any kind of hope. \nWhy did SPS not honor my XXXX assistance application which has now impacted my life and well being Finally, I think SPS is setting me up for failure and wants me to accept a repayment plan that is incorrect and based on wrong information. I can not accept this plan when it's constructed wrongly. \nAll of these delays are adding extra stress which I do not need, why doesn't SPS offer me a new option so we can resolve this issue as soon as possible. \nIf XXXX rejects this complaint, then I forced to keep on writing to them and other agencies, see attached complaint letter. \n\nTo avoid foreclosure, I would take the following steps : Contact my lender as soon as possible and explain my situation. I would try to work out a solution with my lender that can help me keep my home, such as a loan modification, a forbearance, a repayment plan, or a short sale. I would also ask my lender about any assistance programs they may have for borrowers facing hardship. Don't want a short sale or deed in lieu. \nSeek help from a certified, non-profit housing counselor or a legal aid office in my area. They can provide me with free advice and guidance on my options and rights, and help me communicate with my lender and negotiate a favorable outcome. They can also help me avoid any foreclosure scams or frauds that may try to take advantage of my situation.\n\nExplore other resources and programs that may be available to help me prevent foreclosure and stay in my home. For example, I may be eligible for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the Home Affordable XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ), or XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. These are federal programs that can help me lower my monthly mortgage payments, refinance my loan, sell my home for less than I owe, or receive financial assistance if I live in a state that was severely affected by the housing crisis. \nManage my budget and expenses carefully and prioritize my mortgage payments. I would try to cut down on unnecessary spending and save as much money as I can to pay off my mortgage debt. I would also look for ways to increase my income, such as finding a second job, selling some of my assets, or asking for help from family or friends. \nThese are some of the things I would do to avoid foreclosure and keep my home. I hope this helps you understand what you can do to prevent foreclosure and stay in your home.

Does your firm have a debt collection license from my state? If not, say why not. If so, provide the date of the license, the name and previous names on the license, the license number, the valid status of the license and the name, address and telephone number of the state agency issuing the license.

If so, provide the date of the license, the name on the license, the license number, and the name, address and telephone number of the state agency issuing the license. \n\nI have asked for this information because I have some questions. I need to hear from you in writing with all documentation requested herein to make an informed decision about your claim that I owe this money. I expect a one time written communication for this purpose but only in writing provided you fully address each and every item of requested data I seek. In order to make sure that I am not put at any disadvantage, in the meantime please treat this purported debt as being in dispute in its entirety. Nothing contained in my letter should be construed in any way as an admission of any responsibility whatsoever for the purported claim. Failure to respond in writing controverting my allegations and points shall be deemed your admission by your non response and all conflicts shall be resolved in my favor. \n\nIn addition to providing the information requested above, please let me know whether you are prepared to pay me for statutory and punitive damages in an amount not less than the balance you are claiming is owed. If so, please tell me in writing your offer with the amount you will pay me to fully resolve the account with an exchange of mutual general releases which, of course, would require permanent deletion from every CRA file of any reported data, if any. \n\nIn addition to the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act prohibits harassment, false or misleading statements and unfair practices by collection agencies and debt collectors. Some violations of these acts are listed below : 1. They threaten to tell your employer or neighbors about the debt ; 2. Threaten violence against you ; 3. Threaten to have you arrested ; 4. Communicate with you or your spouse more than three times a week ; 5. Harass, intimidate, threaten or embarrass you ; 6. Imply that documents sent to you are legal documents or government documents ; 7. Imply that you can be deported ; or 8. Solicit a postdated check in order to threaten criminal prosecution. \n\nThe CFPB and advocates recommend consumers to also check to see if their state licenses debt collectors and if the company that is contacting them is licensed. If a state does not license debt collectors, check the registry for a neighboring state. Some states also provide licensing information to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX That website will thus provide a few more states where the debt collector might be licensed. I purposely repeat myself to make it clear that I need to know complete details of what licenses you are required to have and what licenses you have. \n\nThe CFPB and others recommend the Stop Contact or Cease Letter strategy to stop collection harassment by writing the collector a stop contact letter, also called a cease letter. Then the collector can only acknowledge the letter and notify the consumer about legal steps the collector may take. This protection usually only applies to collection agencies hired by the creditor or debt buyers that purchased debts from the creditor, but even creditors collecting their own debts must honor such requests as basic agency law requires creditors to be responsible for actions of the bill collector agents. Again, as stated above purposely several times to make the point absolutely clear, please stop contact and cease further communication of any kind whatsoever.\n\nI have also stated several times what advocates call the Exempt Income Letter to avoid fruitless expenses. If a consumers only sources of income are state or federal government benefits, their income may most likely be exempt or protected from collection. If the collector is informed that government benefits are the consumers only source of income, the collector may voluntarily stop contacting them about the alleged debt. Collectors can be informed that all of the consumers income is exempt which I have done to avoid an unreasonable multiplicity of proceedings having no purpose. Again, All of my limited income is from EXEMPT sources! \n\nAgain, you should consider this a Dispute Letter as I DISPUTE the entire purported claim. If the consumer believes the debt is not theirs, that the amount is incorrect, or that there is some other error, the consumer or their attorney should send the collector a dispute letter. Collectors make a lot of mistakes and disputing the debt may help resolve the matter.\n\nFederal law requires debt collectors to provide validation information about the alleged debt and consumers rights to dispute the debt. Collectors will be able to provide this information in writing. \n\nIt is recommended that if a debt collector claims to have sent a notice previously but the consumer never received it, ask for another copy. Keep a copy of any letters that are sent. It is best to send the letter by mail, return receipt requested. A CFPB complaint is the best method to document a DISPUTE and Debt Validation as it not only proves delivery to the Debt Collector but it requires the Debt Collector to respond promptly. Debt Validation letters and Disputes can also be sent electronically using any type of electronic communication that the debt collector uses to accept consumer communications. If the collection agency accepts emails from consumers, the dispute letter can be sent via email. To insure this letter is not lost, delayed in the mail or mishandled by the Debt Collector, I am also sending this letter with any attachments via the CFPB Complaint Portal and website to assure receipt and guarantee a timely response. \n\nAdvocates such as the CFPB state that a dispute letter may be combined with a request for more information in a Verification Letter.\n\nOften it is not even clear what debt a collector is contacting the consumer about, and in that case, the consumer should not pay the collector until more information is obtained. Federal law requires debt collectors to provide validation information about the alleged debt. However, the consumer may still have more questions about the alleged debt. My letter demands documentation which is indispensable in determining the amount and validity of the purported claim. \n\nThe FCRA requires every CRA and Furnishers to maintain reasonable procedures in their operations to assure maximum possible completeness and accuracy of data in the credit reports they report and publish. Credit reporting laws ensure that bureaus report only 100 % accurate credit information. The CFPB has repeatedly criticized the dispute process involving Furnishers and CRAs. CRAs routinely fail to forward complete written disputes to Furnishers and routinely PARROT non existent investigations and certifications from Furnishers and fail to delete and prevent known Facially False Data in violation the recent directives of XXXX XXXX, CFPB Director. To enforce the FCRA, I have filed multiple direct and indirect CRA/Furnisher written disputes including about 100 CFPB complaints yet virtually no dispute is listed on my credit reports as Disputed as required in willful violations of the FCRA and XXXX XXXX protocols. To the extent that your purported debt has been directly or indirectly included in any of my written disputes, in accordance with The Fair Credit Reporting Act, Public law 91-506, Title VI, Section 611, Subsection A-D, please provide ( in addition to all facts regarding investigation records ) the names and business addresses of each individual with whom you client verified the purported debt reporting above, so that I may follow up. Every step must be taken to assure the information reported is completely accurate and correct. Furthermore, each of my credit reports for each account contain different and conflicting data on my paper credit reports and data required from Furnishers is either negligently or purposely missing, impossible, incorrect or conflicting and more importantly, Data submitted through Metro 2 is not contained on my paper credit reports resulting unknowingly to be of current accounts being falsely reported as 60 days late with credit scores being up to 200 points lower than expected. Metro 2 compliance is out of control. For your purported debt, if it has been reported to a CRA, I need the actual Metro 2 submissions ( translated into XXXX ) for the last 3 years including every monthly and required interim submissions. If I have ever disputed an account with any creditor, I expect every credit report to continually contain the required and mandatory notice that it is DISPUTED which is not happening constituting willful FCRA violations. Any further violations of federal statutes will incur liability for actual, statutory, and punitive damages plus attorney fees and costs. \n\n15 USC 1681s-2 : Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies Text contains those laws in effect on XX/XX/XXXX 1681s2. Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies ( a ) Duty of furnishers of information to provide accurate information ( 1 ) Prohibition ( A ) Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. \n( B ) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if- ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. \n\nI insist on 100 % compliance with all FCRA and all statutes and knowingly reporting inaccurate information after notice shall constitute willful and negligent violations of the FCRA, subjecting violators to statutory damages of {$1000.00} per incident plus huge punitive damages for repeated known repeated violations. Any current or future debt collector or debt buyer is obligated to investigate and ascertain the extent of and existence of actual or potential FCRA violations before furnishing data to any CRA. \n\nTo insure compliance with the FCRA and other statutes, your written response must include the purported exact month-day-year for the Date of First Delinquency and the exact day-month-year that the disputed claim would be required to be deleted from every CRA account under the 7 year statute of limitations for credit reporting assuming no payments are made in the future.\n\nThere is a Duty to Provide Notice of Delinquency of Accounts. In order for there to be a uniform date by which all consumer reporting agencies would compute the seven-year reporting period for adverse items of information, Congress included section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) with the intent that the seven-year reporting period begin with the commencement of the delinquency rather than any other date. That section of the FCRA states that \" a person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency regarding a delinquent account being placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action shall. .. notify the agency of the date of delinquency on the account, which shall be the month and year of the commencement of the delinquency on the account that immediately preceded the action. My credit reports for every CRA and for most accounts fails to report the mandatory date of First Delinquency in violation of law. \n\nVirtually every account on each of my credit reports fails to list my account as DISPUTED pursuant to the clear statute requirements. Failing to list a disputed debt as disputed on every CRA is purposely done by Furnishers for a sinister purpose to harm consumers as much as possible to lower credit scores. Once you dispute a debt to a credit reporting agency, they must report that debt as disputed on your credit file and in your credit reports. Also, if you dispute a debt to one of the three major credit reporting agencies ( XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX ), that particular agency must notify the other two bureaus that you dispute the debt. Failing to list the account as disputed, after a valid dispute has been sent to the credit reporting agency, is a violation of the FCRA. Not only are none of my valid disputes listed as disputed on my credit reports, but once a CRA lists my account as Disputed, virtually the next day the Furnisher will erroneously, purposelessly, maliciously, abusively, willfully, deliberately, intentionally and frivolously remove and delete the Disputed required entry using XXXX XXXX mid-cycle unauthorized and prohibited entries in violation of the Facially False Data prevention requirements recently explained in detail by CFPB Director XXXX XXXX. Not only is the entire XXXX XXXX system unworkable but employees are not adequately trained to insure accurate data coding. Willful failures to report accounts as Disputed and closed carry statutory damages of {$1000.00} plus punitive damages for each violation for every time the required entry was changed or deleted. I insist on 100 % compliance with the FCRA and other statutes mandating deletion if all disputed entries permanently. \n\nA common FCRA violation is when a creditor posts late payments after the debt has charged off a past due balance. I will Document this violation by highlighting the accounts on every CRA and by filing a direct and indirect dispute with the Furnisher and every CRA. Care should be taken by the disputed purported debt collector to avoid violating any statutes, if it is stupid enough to report my data to any CRA. \n\nThe United States Supreme Court has held that willful violations of the FCRA include violations committed in reckless disregard of a company 's obligations under FCRA. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  This standard of willfulness is now the law of the land. \n\nIn XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX this suit, alleging that XXXX XXXX XXXX violated its duties as a furnisher of information under FCRA , 15 U.S.C.A. 1681s-2 ( b ) ( 1 ), by failing to report the dispute. At the conclusion of the trial, the court instructed the jury on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  statutory duties as a furnisher of information. The trial court also instructed the jury that it could find XXXX XXXX XXXX  had violated FCRA by failing to report the ongoing dispute After deliberation, the jury returned a verdict finding that XXXX XXXX XXXX  had intentionally violated its duties under FCRA. The jury awarded XXXX no compensatory damages but did award the maximum possible statutory damages of {$1000.00} and punitive damages of {$80000.00}. WOW!!! This means that the failure of a Furnisher to report a DISPUTE on a consumers credit report could result in statutory damages of {$1000.00} plus punitive damages of {$80000.00}. Failure to list my account as dispute, in violation of law, will not help collection efforts and only result in huge damages to ensure and enforce compliance. While many attorneys recommend filing lawsuits right away for obvious FCRA and FDCPA violations, I prefer to give violators repeated notices as I prefer to get {$80000.00} instead of {$1000.00} when a violator is stupid. \n\nI have a right to Privacy. Due to extensive and widespread malicious Willful violations of the FCRA, to protect my right to privacy, I hereby immediately OPT OUT and permanently revoke any right to report data on any of my credit reports as otherwise permitted and set forth in section 313.15 - Other exceptions to notice and opt out requirements- ( 5 ) ( i ) To a consumer reporting agency in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1682 et seq. or ( ii ) From a consumer report reported by a consumer reporting agency. The exceptions can apply if and only if every Furnisher and every CRA comply with ALL of their obligations under the FCRA. Once known violations of the FCRA have been disputed with Furnishers and every CRA multiple times without correction or deletion as required, the rights to report is deemed automatically revoked and an affected consumer may unilaterally OPT OUT entirely of credit reporting in the interest of justice. Consumer rights to OPT OUT from credit reporting to prevent inaccurate reporting TRUMP the rights of disputed creditors to flagrantly abuse the FCRA with impunity. The CFPB recently filed an amicus brief, arguing that furnishers are statutorily obligated to investigate both legal and factual questions raised in consumer disputes. The CFPB 's brief acknowledges that several federal courts have distinguished between \" factual '' and \" legal '' questions in determining the obligation of CRAs to investigate disputes under 15 U.S.C. 1681i. I need a complex analysis of the factual and legal issues and documentation requested herein rather than a worthless bare unsupported denial or statement.\n\nEvery Furnisher and CRA has failed to comply with any of their obligations as set forth in the below statute which is simple to understand.\n\n623. Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies [ 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ] ( a ) Duty of furnishers of information to provide accurate information. \n( 1 ) Prohibition.\n\n* Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors. A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or consciously avoids knowing that the information is inaccurate.\n\n* Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors. A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. \n( C ) No address requirement. A person who clearly and conspicuously specifies to the consumer an address for notices referred to in subparagraph ( B ) shall not be subject to subparagraph ( A ) ; however, nothing in subparagraph ( B ) shall require a person to speciry such an address ( 2 ) Duty to correct and update information. A person who * regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more consumer reporting agencies about the person 's transactions or experiences with any consumer : and * has furnished to a consumer reporting agency information that the person determines is not complete or accurate shall promptly notify the consumer reporting agency of that determination and provide to the agency any corrections to that information, or any additional information. that is necessary to make the information provided by the person to the agency complete and accurate, and shall not thereafter furnish to the agency any of the information that remains not complete or accurate. \n1. Duty to provide notice of dispute. If the completeness or accuracy of any information furnished by any person to any consumer reporting agency is disputed to such person by a consumer, the person may not furnish the information to any consumer reporting agency without notice that such information is disputed by the consumer.\n\n2. Duty to provide notice of closed accounts. A person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency regarding a consumer who has a credit account with that person shall notify the agency of the voluntary closure of the account by the consumer, in information regularly furnished for the period in which the account is closed. \n3. Duty to provide notice of delinquency of accounts. A person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency regarding a delinquent account being placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action shall, not later than 90 days after furnishing the information, notify the agency of the month and year of the commencement of the delinquency that immediately preceded the action.\n\n( b ) Duties of furnishers of information upon notice of dispute.\n\n( 1 ) In general. After receiving notice pursuant to section 611 ( a ) ( 2 ) [ 1681i ] of a dispute with regard to the completeness or accuracy of any information provided by a person to a consumer reporting agency, the person shall * conduct an investigation with respect to the disputed information; * review all relevant information provided by the consumer reporting agency pursuant to section 611 ( a ) ( 2 ) [ 168li ] ; * report the results of the investigation to the consumer reporting agency ; and * if the investigation finds that the information is incomplete or inaccurate, report those results to all other consumer reporting agencies to which the person furnished Simply stated, Furnishers and every CRA willfully and negligently failed to fulfill their mandatory obligations. States and federal authorities seem to attempt to license every possible type of employee, even dog sitters and dog catchers! If a doctor and lawyer needs to be licensed, then it is more important that a XXXX XXXX compliance expert is more important to be licensed to protect the privacy rights of consumers. Send employees back to XXXX XXXX school and refrain from permitting new untrained employees to inaccurately code data entries on consumer credit reports. Some system needs to be in place with comprehensive internal controls to protect consumers from XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX digit codes summarizing complaints without reading and forwarding disputes to Furnishers and other CRAs. We do not need untrained high school students doing the job required by certified EXPERTS. Simple Facially False Data is unable to be detected and corrected after repeated disputes where a Furnisher admits inaccuracies. The entire credit reporting system is a disgrace and the CFPB needs to punish individual violators. I demand complete 100 % compliance with all statutes, federal and state, as a precondition for receiving payment if any kind. CRAs created an unworkable monster with the creation of XXXX XXXX and statutory and punitive damages are the sole remedy to provide consumers with rights required by statutes. We need XXXX XXXX XXXX to continue to partner with CFPB XXXX XXXX XXXX, to lay down the hammer on violators and individual Officers who continue to screw over consumers as part of their DNA. \n\nWouldnt you agree that deliberate violations of the FCRA which unjustly reduces a credit score by XXXX points is wrong?

I asked the representative to apply payments as follows : 1 ) apply a requested amount toward a monthly minimum payment, 2 ) the rest of the money apply toward promotional balances starting with the oldest. The rep XXXX ( XXXX ID XXXX ) and rep XXXX from the financial (? ) department assured me that the payments will be applied as directed. XXXX also read the statement/disclosure indicating that the allocation will be applied as discussed. The call was recorded on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  @ XXXX XXXX EDT. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called THD CC Services and made another payment in the amount of {$640.00} to close the promotional balance only which expires on XX/XX/XXXX. I made two payments during the same billing cycle ( XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ), the minimum monthly payment was covered during the XX/XX/XXXX payment. The due date is the XXXX day of each month. The reference number is XXXX XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX EDT. On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that the payment in the amount of {$640.00} was not applied toward my expiring promotional but applied only partially and the monthly minimum was taken out of this payment again leaving the outstanding balance of {$450.00}. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX EDT. The rep XXXX from a supervisor team assured me during the verbal statement on a recorded line that my payment in the amount of {$640.00} made on XX/XX/XXXX will be re-applied toward an expiring promotional as a requested XXXX  out the outstanding balance. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that the outstanding balance of promotional charges in the amount of {$640.00} is indeed XXXX out, but the balance was moved to an earlier closed promotional charge which now generates compound interest daily. This is not a first assurance when THD CC services employ deceptive practices. The consumer has no options to make payments as needed, instead, the consumer is forced to call in to request an allocation otherwise the promotional charges can not be paid overtime but must be paid along with the monthly payments. The CC Services do have the option to allocate additional money to promotional charges, but the consumer can only select up to 3 expiring promotional charges and the funds will be allocated in the way that only 33 % will be allocated to the first promotional charge, 33 % to the second, and 33 % to third, or if a consumer selects to pay off two promotional charges, then only 50 % will go toward the first selected charge, and 50 % to the second promotional charge. But if the consumer wants to pay off several ( two or more ) promotional charges at the same payment, there is no way to select 100 % for each promotional outstanding balance. The consumer must call in. However, even if the consumer calls in and requests payment allocation, that does not guarantee that the payments will be allocated as requested. The payments can be allocated whatever the \" system '' allocates which makes the tracing of allocation of funds incredibly difficult. This is a deceptive practice by THD CC services and I am certain that many if not thousands or hundreds of thousands of consumers are affected by this practice.

This process has been handled in such a way as to create XXXX  and confusion regarding the mortgage loan servicing transfer process by lack of timely and sufficiently clear notification. I will add that I have had previous mortgages that underwent servicing transfer and I do not recall those transfers being anything but smooth transitions that did not require action on my part, other than to establish an account with the new servicer. \n\nThis is the sequence of events : I received a letter from Flagstar Mortgage regarding the mortgage servicing transfer, as of XX/XX/2023, but no information was available as to the process. I was informed by USPS mail, with no concomitant email notification or follow-up notification. I was informed of the name of the new servicer, XXXX, and that the transfer date from Flagstar to XXXX was as of XX/XX/2023. The letter also stated that I could expect communication from XXXX. \n\nThe date of XX/XX/2023 was not, however, the date of transfer to the new servicer, XXXX, as XX/XX/2023 was a Sunday. I took as fact the statement in the letter that XX/XX/2023 was the date of transfer, and I attempted to establish an account with XXXX on XX/XX/2023, because I had a busy week ahead and wished to get it done and off of my mind. I learned on XX/XX/2023 that I was not yet in the XXXX system and was not successful in attempting to establish an account with XXXX. On Monday XX/XX/2023, due to obligations, I did not have an opportunity to contact XXXX online or by phone. Today, Tuesday, XX/XX/2023, I contacted XXXX online and I established a new account with XXXX. On the XXXX website I was apprised that I would not have had to cancel my auto-pay service with Flagstar. I had already cancelled my auto-pay because no such information as to my ability to preserve my auto-pay account was offered on the Flagstar website or in the service-transfer notification letter I received. Of course I had already canceled my auto-pay when I was made aware that I did not have to cancel. After establishing my XXXX account I also learned that I I would not be able to make my XX/XX/2023 & first mortgage payment with XXXX until XXXX. So now I have to make sure I establish my auto-pay account with XXXX on the day I submit my first payment on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nIn summary, Flagstar did not do the right thing, & XXXX did not contact me via USPS or via the internet. But they followed the loose rules that govern such events. The rules regarding notification timeliness and process specifics need to be revised to accommodate an American public that do most of their banking and mortgage servicing business via the internet. Providers haven't kept up with communications expectations of customers because there are no rules that require them to do so. This leaves the customer responsible for interpreting the ambiguities of inadequate communication from both servicers, especially amid the indifference of the old servicer to providing accurate information to the old customer, regarding the transfer to the new servicer. \n\nThe level of incompetence or just sheer indifference to effective communication on the part of Flagstar is astounding!

He let me know that this would be taken care of since I owed them no money, this was an error on their end for not closing down that line as well. \n\nAnother couple of months later I got another letter from XXXX for the same thing, I called and spoke to another representative, a very nice lady, who went over the account and was able to verify that all the original information from my XXXX call was there written. She apologized for the inconvenience and said she would be contacting the original XXXX, XXXX or XXXX, to have this taken care of. I asked her to send me an email confirming this information but she said she couldn't, something about not being able to send external emails or such, but not to worry, it would be taken care of. \n\nFast forward another month or so and I get a collection letter from Diversified a collections agency trying to collect over XXXX, a representative of theirs called me to collect the debt, I told her what was going on and that I was not paying anything because I owed no money, that they needed to contact XXXX to get the story straight. She was extremely rude and impolite, but said she'd be sending me a letter regarding the collection which I received a few weeks ago. \n\nI am at a loss at this point, I don't know what to do because I feel like I am being harassed for money I do not owe.

I wanted to start using XXXX again because Im opening another bank account. When I try to make sure it was registered, it did not work and I called the bank and they could not tell me what the issue was. They said they were going to open a case for someone to look into it and contact me. They said it would be three business days. The next day I tried to do an external transfer but Ally wouldnt allow me to link another bank that way either. I chatted with someone who told me that this is relating to my XXXX issue and its still being looked into. They still could not provide me with any information. Yesterday at around XXXX XXXX  I received a missed call no voicemail was left so I googled the number and it said it was Ally bank. I called Ally Bank and the guy told me that he did not see a missed call and he didnt have any updates on my case. He was continuing to look at my account & the call disconnected. I didnt know what happened but he told me that there was no updates, so I did not feel a need to call back.

I immediately called back and asked for a supervisor and the agent that I reached told me that I could not speak with one. They said there was none available. She did allow me to leave a voicemail though. I expressed that I was very frustrated with the experience that I have been having the past few days. No one has been able to give me any information. The agent proceeded to ask several security questions, and the last few asked if I ever filed a XXXX dispute, or if anyone ever filed one against me? I said no And the agent still said she could not give me any more information and she will forward my answers to the investigation team. I left a voicemail for a supervisor but I am very upset by this whole interaction and I want my issue resolved as soon as possible.
